The purpose of developing the new approach is to\nprovide a self-consistent and simple description of the Earth's rotation in a\nway that can be estimated directly from observations without using intermediate\nquantities.\n  METHODS: Instead of estimating the time series of pole coordinates, the\nUT1--TAI angles, their rates, and the daily offsets of nutation, it is proposed\nto estimate coefficients of the expansion of a small perturbational rotation\nvector into basis functions. The resulting transformation from the terrestrial\ncoordinate system to the celestial coordinate system is formulated as a product\nof an a priori matrix of a finite rotation and an empirical vector of a\nresidual perturbational rotation. In the framework of this approach, the\nspecific choice of the a priori matrix is irrelevant, provided the angles of\nthe residual rotation are small enough to neglect their squares. The\ncoefficients of the expansion into the B-spline and Fourier bases, together\nwith estimates of other nuisance parameters, are evaluated directly from\nobservations of time delay or time range in a single least square solution.\n  RESULTS: This approach was successfully implemented in a computer program for\nprocessing VLBI observations. The dataset from 1984 through 2006 was analyzed.\nThe new procedure adequately represents the Earth's rotation, including slowly\nvarying changes in UT1--TAI and polar motion, the forced nutations, the free\ncore nutation, and the high frequency variations of polar motion and UT1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Nov 2006 01:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jun 2007 01:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Topological characteristics have profound\nimpact on the efficiency of search on such unstructured P2P networks as well as\nother networks. It has been well-known that search on small-world topologies of\nN nodes can be as efficient as O(ln N), while scale-free (power-law) topologies\noffer even better search efficiencies like as good as O(lnln N) for a range of\ndegree distribution exponents. However, generation and maintenance of such\nscale-free topologies are hard to realize in a distributed and potentially\nuncooperative environments as in the P2P networks. A key limitation of\nscale-free topologies is the high load (i.e. high degree) on very few number of\nhub nodes. In a typical unstructured P2P network, peers are not willing to\nmaintain high degrees/loads as they may not want to store large number of\nentries for construction of the overlay topology. So, to achieve fairness and\npracticality among all peers, hard cutoffs on the number of entries are imposed\nby the individual peers, which limits scale-freeness of the overall topology.\nThus, efficiency of the flooding search reduces as the size of the hard cutoff\ndoes. We investigate construction of scale-free topologies with hard cutoffs\n(i.e. there are not any major hubs) and effect of these hard cutoffs on the\nsearch efficiency.
