Observations of such\nbinary pulsars allow the measurement of general relativistic effects, which in\nturn lead to information about the orbiting objects and, in a few cases, to\ntests of theories of gravity. Methods: Regular timing observations have been\ncarried out with three of the largest European radio telescopes involved in\npulsar research. The prospects of continued observations were studied with\nsimulated timing data. Pulse scattering times were measured using dedicated\nobservations at 1.4 GHz and at 3.1 GHz, and the corresponding spectral index\nhas also been determined. The possibility of detecting the yet unseen companion\nas a radio pulsar was also investigated. A study of the natal kick received by\nthe younger neutron star at birth was performed. Results: We present an up to\ndate and improved timing solution for the binary pulsar PSR J1811-1736. One\npost-Keplerian parameter, the relativistic periastron advance, is measured and\nleads to the determination of the total mass of this binary system. The pulse\nprofile at 1.4 GHz is heavily broadened by interstellar scattering, limiting\nthe timing precision achievable at this frequency and the measurability of\nother post-keplerian parameters. Interstellar scattering is unlikely to be the\nreason for the continued failure to detect radio pulsations from the companion\nof PSR J1811-1736.

On the basis of a\ngeneral formulation for the transiting signature in the stellar light curve and\nthe velocity anomaly due to the Rossiter effect, we compute the expected\nsignals analytically for a face-on ring system, and numerically for more\ngeneral configurations. We study the detectability of a ring around a\ntransiting planet located at a=3AU for a variety of obliquity and azimuthal\nangles, and find that it is possible to detect the ring signature both\nphotometrically and spectroscopically unless the ring is almost edge-on (i.e.,\nthe obliquity angle of the ring \\theta is much less than unity). We also\nconsider the detectability of planetary rings around a close-in planet, HD\n209458b ($\\theta\\approx 90^\\circ-i_{\\rm orbit} \\approx 3^\\circ.32$), and Saturn\n($\\theta \\approx 26^\\circ.7$) as illustrative examples. While the former is\ndifficult to detect with the current precision (photometric precision of 10^-4\nand radial velocity precision of 1 m/s), a marginal detection of the latter is\npossible photometrically. If the future precision of the radial velocity\nmeasurement reaches even below 0.1 m/s, they will be even detectable from the\nground-based spectroscopic observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2006 03:37:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Aug 2008 06:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}

Like water circling a drain, inflowing mass must lose angular\nmomentum, presumably by vigorous turbulence in disks, which are essentially\ninviscid. The origin of the turbulence is unclear. Hot disks of electrically\nconducting plasma can become turbulent by way of the linear magnetorotational\ninstability. Cool disks, such as the planet-forming disks of protostars, may be\ntoo poorly ionized for the magnetorotational instability to occur, hence\nessentially unmagnetized and linearly stable. Nonlinear hydrodynamic\ninstability often occurs in linearly stable flows (for example, pipe flows) at\nsufficiently large Reynolds numbers. Although planet-forming disks have extreme\nReynolds numbers, Keplerian rotation enhances their linear hydrodynamic\nstability, so the question of whether they can be turbulent and thereby\ntransport angular momentum effectively is controversial.

Thus, an\ninteresting feature that emerges from our work is the contrast in the interplay\nbetween squeezing and thermal effects in non-dissipative and dissipative\ninteractions. This can be useful for the practical implementation of geometric\nquantum information processing. By interpreting the open quantum effects as\nnoisy channels, we make the connection between geometric phase and quantum\nnoise processes familiar from quantum information theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2006 11:33:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2007 09:58:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Oct 2007 13:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
