We discover the existence of an electron bremsstrahlung\ncomponent in the aurorae, which accounts for essentially all the X-ray flux\nabove 2 keV: its presence had been predicted but never detected for lack of\nsensitivity of previous X-ray missions. This bremsstrahlung component varied\nsignificantly in strength and spectral shape over the 3.5 days covered by the\nNov. 2003 observation, displaying substantial hardening of the spectrum with\nincreasing flux. This variability may be linked to the strong solar activity\ntaking place at the time, and may be induced by changes in the acceleration\nmechanisms inside Jupiter's magnetosphere. As in Apr. 2003, the auroral spectra\nbelow 2 keV are best fitted by a superposition of line emission most likely\noriginating from ion charge exchange, with OVII playing the dominant role. We\nstill cannot resolve conclusively the ion species responsible for the lowest\nenergy lines (around 0.3 keV), so the question of the origin of the ions\n(magnetospheric or solar wind) is still open.

For comparison we compile and homogenize M/L literature data for 60\nnearby galaxies that were modeled in comparable detail. The nearby sample obeys\nlog(M/L)_B = Z + S log(sigma_eff/[200 km/s]), with Z = 0.896 +/- 0.010, S =\n0.992 +/- 0.054, and sigma_eff the effective velocity dispersion.

The implied M/L\nevolution is Delta log(M/L) / Delta z = -0.457 +/- 0.046(random) +/-\n0.078(systematic), consistent with passive evolution following high-redshift\nformation. This agrees with the FP results for this sample by van Dokkum & van\nder Marel. This confirms that FP evolution tracks M/L evolution, which is an\nimportant verification of the assumptions that underly FP studies. However,\nwhile we find more FP evolution for galaxies of low sigma_eff (or low mass),\nthe dynamical M/L evolution instead shows little trend with sigma_eff. We argue\nthat this difference can be plausibly attributed to a combination of two\neffects: (a) evolution in structural galaxy properties other than M/L; and (b)\nthe neglect of rotational support in studies of FP evolution. The results leave\nthe question open whether the low-mass galaxies in the sample have younger\npopulation ages than the high-mass galaxies. This highlights the general\nimportance in the study of population ages for complementing dynamical\nmeasurements with broad-band colors or spectroscopic population diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 20:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

It emerges that in\ngeneral, two bond lengths are required for obtaining minimum energy structure,\nin contrast to one bond length commonly used. The difference in bond lengths\ndepends on chirality and radius of achiral tubes. Significantly, even a small\ndeviation from zigzag or armchair character leads to interesting behavior of\nbond lengths. A reduction in diameter is responsible for difference in the bond\nlengths of achiral nanotubes. We also calculate the bond lengths under\nhydrostatic pressure.

The sizes obtained from the\nMD simulations have been validated by Small Angle X-Ray Scattering (SAXS)\nexperiment on dendrimer of generation 2 to 4 (G2-G4). A good agreement between\nthe experimental and theoretical value of radius of gyration has been observed.\nWe find a linear increase in radius of gyration with the generation. In\ncontrast, Rg scales as ~ N^x with the number of monomers. We find two distinct\nexponents depending on the generations: x = 0.47 for G1-G3 and x = 0.28 for\nG3-G6 which reveals their non-space filling nature. In comparison with the\namine terminated PAMAM dendrimer, we find Rg of G-th generation PETIM dendrimer\nis nearly equal to that of (G+1)-th generation of PAMAM dendrimer as observed\nby Maiti et. al. [Macromolecules,38, 979 2005]. We find substantial back\nfolding of the outer sub generations into the interior of the dendrimer. Due to\ntheir highly flexible nature of the repeating branch units, the shape of the\nPETIM dendrimer deviates significantly from the spherical shape and the\nmolecules become more and more spherical as the generation increases. The\ninterior of the dendrimer is quite open with internal cavities available for\naccommodating guest molecules suggesting using PETIM dendrimer for guest-host\napplications. We also give a quantitative measure of the number of water\nmolecules present inside the dendrimer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2006 12:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Traditionally, an operator uses the relative\nabundance of ions with specific mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios to categorize\nspectra. An operator does this by comparing the spectrum of m/z versus\nabundance of an unknown sample against a library of spectra from known samples.\nAutomated positioning and acquisition allow I^2LD-FTMS to acquire data from\nvery large grids, this would require classification of up to 3600 spectrum per\nhour to keep pace with the acquisition.

The former class of\nproblems concern the construction of a graphical model in order to define a new\ncode. The latter class of problems concern the extraction of a graphical model\nfor a (fixed) given code. The design of a new low-density parity-check code for\nsome given criteria (e.g. target block length and code rate) is an example of a\nconstructive problem. The determination of a graphical model for a classical\nlinear block code which implies a decoding algorithm with desired performance\nand complexity characteristics is an example of an extractive problem. This\nwork focuses on extractive graphical model problems and aims to lay out some of\nthe foundations of the theory of such problems for linear codes.\n  The primary focus of this work is a study of the space of all graphical\nmodels for a (fixed) given code. The tradeoff between cyclic topology and\ncomplexity in this space is characterized via the introduction of a new bound:\nthe tree-inducing cut-set bound. The proposed bound provides a more precise\ncharacterization of this tradeoff than that which can be obtained using\nexisting tools (e.g. the Cut-Set Bound) and can be viewed as a generalization\nof the square-root bound for tail-biting trellises to graphical models with\narbitrary cyclic topologies.

At the same order in perturbation\ntheory, weak boson emission diagrams contribute. Since the W and Z bosons are\nmassive, the O(alpha) virtual weak radiative corrections and the contributions\nfrom weak boson emission are separately finite. Thus, unlike in QED or QCD\ncalculations, there is no technical reason for including gauge boson emission\ndiagrams in calculations of electroweak radiative corrections. In most\ncalculations of the O(alpha) electroweak radiative corrections, weak boson\nemission diagrams are therefore not taken into account.

In\ngeneral, I find that the cross section for weak boson emission is substantial\nat high energies and that weak boson emission and the O(alpha) virtual weak\nradiative corrections partially cancel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 22:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We find that usage highly correlates with the structure\nof the communication network, and demonstrate the coexistence on the same\nsocial network of two distinct usage classes, network effects being responsible\nfor the quantifiable differences between them. To test the predictive power of\nour theory, we demonstrate that traditional marketing techniques are\nineffective in permanently boosting service adoption, and propose a hub-based\nincentive mechanism that has the potential to enhance usage for one of the two\nservice classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2006 00:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the\nideal case emergent properties on the tissue scale can be derived from the\ncellular scale. However, this has been achieved in rare examples only, in\nparticular, when involving high-speed migration of cells. One major difficulty\nis the lack of a suitable multiscale simulation platform, which embeds\nreaction-diffusion of soluble substances, fast cell migration and mechanics,\nand, being of great importance in several tissue types, cell flow homeostasis.\nIn this paper a step into this direction is presented by developing an\nagent-based mathematical model specifically designed to incorporate these\nfeatures with special emphasis on high speed cell migration. Cells are\nrepresented as elastic spheres migrating on a substrate in lattice-free space.\nTheir movement is regulated and guided by chemoattractants that can be derived\nfrom the substrate. The diffusion of chemoattractants is considered to be\nslower than cell migration and, thus, to be far from equilibrium. Tissue\nhomeostasis is not achieved by the balance of growth and death but by a flow\nequilibrium of cells migrating in and out of the tissue under consideration. In\nthis sense the number and the distribution of the cells in the tissue is a\nresult of the model and not part of the assumptions. For purpose of\ndemonstration of the model properties and functioning, the model is applied to\na prominent example of tissue in a cellular flow equilibrium, the secondary\nlymphoid tissue. The experimental data on cell speed distributions in these\ntissues can be reproduced using reasonable mechanical parameters for the\nsimulated cell migration in dense tissue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 16:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jun 2007 12:13:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In contrast to other problems of pattern\nformation, here, the homeostasis of the cell population is not governed by a\ngrowth-death balance but by a flow equilibrium of migrating cells.

This observation has often been rationalized on the basis of a\nnucleation mechanism for protein folding whose basic premise is the idea that\nafter completion of a specific set of contacts forming the so-called folding\nnucleus the native state is achieved promptly. Here we propose a methodology to\nidentify folding nuclei in small lattice polymers and apply it to the study of\nprotein molecules with chain length N=48. To investigate the extent to which\nprotein topology is a robust determinant of the nucleation mechanism we compare\nthe nucleation scenario of a native-centric model with that of a sequence\nspecific model sharing the same native fold. To evaluate the impact of the\nsequence's finner details in the nucleation mechanism we consider the folding\nof two non- homologous sequences. We conclude that in a sequence-specific model\nthe folding nucleus is, to some extent, formed by the most stable contacts in\nthe protein and that the less stable linkages in the folding nucleus are solely\ndetermined by the fold's topology. We have also found that independently of\nprotein sequence the folding nucleus performs the same `topological' function.\nThis unifying feature of the nucleation mechanism results from the residues\nforming the folding nucleus being distributed along the protein chain in a\nsimilar and well-defined manner that is determined by the fold's topological\nfeatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 20:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-09"}
