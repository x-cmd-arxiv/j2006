Second, we obtain semi-analytic solutions for a mildly\nrelativistic flow in which the rest mass energy density is not negligible in\nthe equation of state.

The phonon dispersions of SWNTs are strongly shaped\nby the effects of electron-phonon coupling. We analyze the separate\ncontributions of curvature and confinement. Confinement plays a major role in\nmodifying SWNT phonons and is often more relevant than curvature. Due to their\none-dimensional character, metallic tubes are expected to undergo Peierls\ndistortions (PD) at T=0K. At finite temperature, PD are no longer present, but\nphonons with atomic displacements similar to those of the PD are affected by\nstrong Kohn anomalies (KA). We investigate by Density Functional Theory (DFT)\nKA and PD in metallic SWNTs with diameters up to 3 nm, in the electronic\ntemperature range from 4K to 3000 K. We then derive a set of simple formulas\naccounting for all the DFT results. Finally, we prove that the static approach,\ncommonly used for the evaluation of phonon frequencies in solids, fails because\nof the SWNTs reduced dimensionality. The correct description of KA in metallic\nSWNTs can be obtained only by using a dynamical approach, beyond the adiabatic\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation, by taking into account non-adiabatic\ncontributions. Dynamic effects induce significant changes in the occurrence and\nshape of Kohn anomalies. We show that the SWNT Raman G peak can only be\ninterpreted considering the combined dynamic, curvature and confinement\neffects.

The flow is\ntaken to be initially steady, and the boundary deformation is assumed to be\nslow compared to the fluid motion. The Eulerian flow is found to remain\napproximately steady throughout the evolution. At leading order, the velocity\nfield depends instantaneously on the shape of the domain boundary, and it is\ndetermined by the steadiness and vorticity-preservation conditions. This is\nmade explicit by reformulating the problem in terms of an area-preserving\ndiffeomorphism $\\gL$ which transports the vorticity. The first-order correction\nto the velocity field is linear in the boundary velocity, and we show how it\ncan be computed from the time-derivative of $\\gL$.\n  The evolution of the Lagrangian position of fluid particles is also examined.\nThanks to vorticity conservation, this position can be specified by an\nangle-like coordinate along vorticity contours. An evolution equation for this\nangle is derived, and the net change in angle resulting from a cyclic\ndeformation of the domain boundary is calculated. This includes a geometric\ncontribution which can be expressed as the integral of a certain curvature over\nthe interior of the circuit that is traced by the parameters defining the\ndeforming boundary.\n  A perturbation approach using Lie series is developed for the computation of\nboth the Eulerian flow and geometric angle for small deformations of the\nboundary.

If G is a word\nhyperbolic group which is delta hyperbolic with respect to a symmetric\ngenerating set S, then there is a positive constant C depending only on delta\nand on |S| such that every element of G either has a power which is conjugate\nto its inverse, or else the stable commutator length is at least equal to C. By\nBavard's theorem, these lower bounds on stable commutator length imply the\nexistence of quasimorphisms with uniform control on the defects; however, we\nshow how to construct such quasimorphisms directly.\n  We also prove various separation theorems, constructing homogeneous\nquasimorphisms (again with uniform estimates) which are positive on some\nprescribed element while vanishing on some family of independent elements whose\ntranslation lengths are uniformly bounded.\n  Finally, we prove that the first accumulation point for stable commutator\nlength in a torsion-free word hyperbolic group is contained between 1/12 and\n1/2.

We advocate the effective sample size method\nas a simple and accessible approach for case-control association analysis with\ncorrelated samples. This method modifies the chi-square test statistic,\np-value, and 95% confidence interval of the odds-ratio by replacing the\napparent number of allele or genotype counts with the effective ones in the\nstandard formula, without the need for specialized computer programs. We\npresent a simple formula for calculating effective sample size for many types\nof relative pairs and relative sets.

Our approach to decoherence control in contrast to other approaches\nin the literature involves the bilinear input affine model of quantum control\nsystem which lends itself to various techniques from classical control theory,\nbut with non-trivial modifications to the quantum regime. The elegance of this\napproach yields interesting results on open loop decouplability and Decoherence\nFree Subspaces(DFS).
