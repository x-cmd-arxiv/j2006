When described by granular\nhydrodynamic equations, the basic steady state of this system is an azimuthally\nsymmetric state of increased particle density at the exterior circle of the\nannulus. When the inelastic energy loss is sufficiently large, hydrodynamics\npredicts spontaneous symmetry breaking of the annular state, analogous to the\nvan der Waals-like phase separation phenomenon previously found in a driven\ngranular gas in rectangular geometry. At a fixed aspect ratio of the annulus,\nthe phase separation involves a \"spinodal interval\" of particle area fractions,\nwhere the gas has negative compressibility in the azimuthal direction. The heat\nconduction in the azimuthal direction tends to suppress the instability, as\ncorroborated by a marginal stability analysis of the basic steady state with\nrespect to small perturbations. To test and complement our theoretical\npredictions we performed event-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of\nthis system. We clearly identify the transition to phase separated states in\nthe MD simulations, despite large fluctuations present, by measuring the\nprobability distribution of the amplitude of the fundamental Fourier mode of\nthe azimuthal spectrum of the particle density.

Models for\nthe LFWFs of hadrons in (3+1) dimensions displaying confinement at large\ndistances and conformal symmetry at short distances have been obtained using\nthe AdS/CFT method. We also compute the LFWFs in this model in invariant three\ndimensional coordinate space. We find that in the models studied, the Fourier\ntransform of the DVCS amplitudes exhibit diffraction patterns. The results are\nanalogous to the diffractive scattering of a wave in optics where the\ndistribution in \\sigma measures the physical size of the scattering center in a\none-dimensional system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Nov 2006 04:26:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2006 17:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
