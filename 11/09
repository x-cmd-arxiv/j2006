The dwarf is placed on a highly eccentric orbit, its\ninitial stellar component is in the form of an exponential disk and it has a\nNFW-like dark matter halo. After 10 Gyrs of evolution the dwarf produces a\nspheroidal stellar component and is strongly tidally stripped so that mass\nfollows light and the stars are on almost isotropic orbits.

A\ncommonly used type of decision tree is the alphabetic binary tree, which uses\n(without loss of generality) ``less than'' versus ''greater than or equal to''\ntests in order to determine one of $n$ outcome events. The process of finding\nan optimal alphabetic binary tree for a known probability distribution on\noutcome events usually has the underlying assumption that the cost (time) per\ndecision is uniform and thus independent of the outcome of the decision. This\nassumption, however, is incorrect in the case of software to be optimized for a\ngiven microprocessor, e.g., in compiling switch statements or in fine-tuning\nprogram bottlenecks. The operation of the microprocessor generally means that\nthe cost for the more likely decision outcome can or will be less -- often far\nless -- than the less likely decision outcome. Here we formulate a variety of\n$O(n^3)$-time $O(n^2)$-space dynamic programming algorithms to solve such\noptimal binary decision tree problems, optimizing for the behavior of\nprocessors with predictive branch capabilities, both static and dynamic. In the\nstatic case, we use existing results to arrive at entropy-based performance\nbounds.

A classical approach to dealing with the multiplicity problem is\nto restrict attention to procedures that control the familywise error rate\n($\\mathit{FWER}$), the probability of even one false rejection. But if $s$ is\nlarge, control of the $\\mathit{FWER}$ is so stringent that the ability of a\nprocedure that controls the $\\mathit{FWER}$ to detect false null hypotheses is\nlimited. It is therefore desirable to consider other measures of error control.\nThis article considers two generalizations of the $\\mathit{FWER}$. The first is\nthe $k-\\mathit{FWER}$, in which one is willing to tolerate $k$ or more false\nrejections for some fixed $k\\geq 1$. The second is based on the false discovery\nproportion ($\\mathit{FDP}$), defined to be the number of false rejections\ndivided by the total number of rejections (and defined to be 0 if there are no\nrejections).

This is the case, e.g., of the geometric and harmonic averages, for\nwhich we obtain permissibility criteria. Also, some important inequalities\ninvolving covariance functions and preference relations as well as algebraic\nproperties can be derived by means of the proposed approach. In particular, we\nshow that quasi-arithmetic covariances allow for ordering and preference\nrelations, for a Jensen-type inequality and for a minimal and maximal element\nof their class.

The possible connection between the presence of a\nfluctuation peak and the occurrence of a phase transition or a critical\nphenomenon is critically analyzed. Many different phenomena can lead both to\nthe creation and to the suppression of a fluctuation peak. In particular, the\nrole of constraints due to conservation laws and to data sorting is shown to be\nessential. From the experimental point of view, a comparison of the available\nfragmentation data reveals that there is a good agreement between different\ndata sets of basic fluctuation observables, if the fragmenting source is of\ncomparable size. This compatibility suggests that the fragmentation process is\nlargely independent of the reaction mechanism (central versus peripheral\ncollisions, symmetric versus asymmetric systems, light ions versus heavy ion\ninduced reactions). Configurational energy fluctuations, that may give\nimportant information on the heat capacity of the fragmenting system at the\nfreeze out stage, are not fully compatible among different data sets and\nrequire further analysis to properly account for Coulomb effects and secondary\ndecays.
