These data allow us to study in detail the\nprominent Ne and O emission line complexes which make 4U 1626-67 unique among\nLMXBs. The observations were spaced over a period of 3 years for a total\nobserving time of 238 ks, allowing us to monitor the line regions as well as\nthe overall source flux, continuum spectrum, and timing properties. The\nstructure of the emission lines and the ratios of the components of the\nhelium-like Ne IX and O VII triplets support the hypothesis that they are\nformed in the high-density environment of the accretion disk. We do not find\nany significant changes in the line widths or ratios over this time period,\nthough we note that the line equivalent widths decrease. We are able to place\nconstraints on the strengths of the Ne K, Fe L, and O K photoelectric\nabsorption edges, and find that the data do not require an overabundance of Ne\nor O in the system relative to the expected ISM values. We find that the pulsar\nis still spinning down, and note that the pulse profile has changed\nsignificantly from what was found prior to the torque reversal in 1990,\nsuggesting that this event may be linked to a change in the geometry of the\naccretion column. The flux of 4U 1626-67 continues to decrease, in keeping with\nthe trend of the last approximately 30 years over which it has been observed.\nTaking into consideration current theory on disk stability, we expect that 4U\n1626-67 will enter a period of quiescence in 2-15 years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2006 21:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The scheme may be\nused to achieve two different tasks. On the one hand it allows the extraction\nof information with minimum disturbance about a set of coherent states. On the\nother hand, it represents a nondemolitive measurement scheme for the\nannihilation operator, i.e. an indirect measurement of the Q-function. We\ninvestigate the information/disturbance trade-off for state inference and\nintroduce the estimation/distortion trade-off to assess estimation of the\nQ-function. For coherent states chosen from a Gaussian set we evaluate both\ninformation/disturbance and estimation/distortion trade-offs and found that non\nuniversal protocols may be optimized in order to achieve better performances\nthan universal ones. For Fock number states we prove that universal protocols\ndo not exist and evaluate the estimation/distortion trade-off for a thermal\ndistribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2006 13:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 2007 08:59:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 Jul 2007 08:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-04"}
