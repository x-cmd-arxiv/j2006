This source was\nobserved 5 times from 1996 to 2001 with durations ranging from a day to four\ndays. The intrinsic continuum, is absorbed at low energies by a complex system:\na cold patchy absorber plus a warm uniform screen photoionized by the central\ncontinuum. We find that this dual absorber is the main driver of the observed\nvariability, up to a factor of eight, at 3 keV. In particular the covering\nfraction of the cold absorber changes on time scales of the order of a day,\nsupporting its association with the Broad Line Region. The column density of\nthe warm gas varies on a longer time scale (months to year). Some of the small\namplitude spectral variability above 10 keV can be explained with an intrinsic\nvariation (\\Delta\\Gamma~0.2).The flux below 1 keV remains constant confirming\nan extended origin. Its spectrum is reproduced by a combination of a thermal\ncomponent and a power law with the same slope as the intrinsic continuum but\nwith an intensity a few per cent. A Compton reflection component is\nsignificantly detected in 1996 (averaged value of \\Omega/2\\pi ~0.4), with\nintensity decreasing on time scale of year, and it desappears in 2000 and 2001.\nThe long time scale of variations argues for an association with an optically\nthick torus at a distance of few light years. An iron line was detected in all\nspectra. Its energy is consistent with fluorescence by cold iron. We find that\nthe line is variable. Its behaviour is reproduced by a variable component\nproportional to the level of the reflection flux plus a constant component. The\nflux of the latter is consistent with the extended line emission observed by\nChandra. We conclude that the first component is likely arising from the torus\nand the second is produced in the extended Narrow Line Region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2006 17:11:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

These neutrinos could be a powerful tool both to resolve the mystery\nof the UHECR sources and to test fundamental physics at the $\\sim$100 TeV\nscale. The optical technique is not cost effective at these energies and newer\ntechniques such as radio and acoustic detection are necessary. Accelerator\nexperiments have confirmed the production of both types of signals from\nhigh-energy showers in various media, and quantitative measurements have\nconfirmed theoretical descriptions of the signal strength, frequency content\nand pulse shape. While radio experiments have set the strongest limits so far,\nthe acoustic method could contribute with an entirely independent signal\nproduction and detection mechanism and may be more effective at the highest\nenergies. Efforts are underway to develop the acoustic method in various media\naround the world, with arrays operating in ocean water at the Bahamas, the UK,\nand the Mediterranean Sea; detectors prepared for deployment in the South Pole\nice in the next year; and ideas for future acoustic detectors in salt domes and\non Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf.

The run of the gravitational potential as a\nfunction of distance is probed studying the velocity dispersion profile of the\ncluster, as derived from a set of 125 radial velocities with accuracy better\nthan 1 km/s. The velocity dispersion profile is traced up to ~18 pc from the\ncluster center. The dispersion is found to be maximal at the center, then\ndecrease until 10+-2 pc from the center, well inside the cluster tidal radius\nof 42 pc. After that the dispersion remains constant with average value\n2.2+-0.3 km/s. Assuming for NGC 7099 a total V mag of M(V)=-7.43 mags and\nmass-to-light ratio M/L=1, the acceleration at 10 pc from the center is 1.1e-8\ncm/s/s. Thus, the flattening of the velocity dispersion profile occurs for a\nvalue of the internal acceleration of gravity fully consistent with a_0=1.2e-8\ncm/s/s observed in galaxies. This new result for NGC 7099 brings to 4 the\nclusters with velocity dispersion profile probing acceleration below a_0. All\nfour have been found to have a flat dispersion profile at large radii where the\nacceleration is below a_0, mimicking qualitatively and quantitatively\nelliptical galaxies. Whether this indicates a failure of Newtonian dynamics in\nthe low acceleration limit or some more conventional dynamical effect (e.g.,\ntidal heating) is still unclear. However, the similarities emerging between\nvery different globular clusters, as well as between globular clusters and\nelliptical galaxies seem to favor the first of these two possibilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2006 22:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The Serpens Cloud Core is ideally\nsuited for this type of investigation, being populated by a dense and extremely\nyoung cluster whose members are found in all different evolutionary stages,\nincluding six well studied Class 0 sources.

We also present an alternative approach\nto the partitioning of the energy flux which differs from that of Alicki in\nthat the instantaneous interaction energy with the external field is not\nincluded directly. We then proceed to generalize Alicki's definition of power\nby replacing the original system and its external driving field with a larger,\nbipartite system, governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian. Using the\ndefinition of heat flux and the generalized definition of power, we derive the\nfirst law of thermodynamics in differential form, both for the full bipartite\nsystem and the partially traced subsystems.
