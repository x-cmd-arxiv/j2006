Using a powerful combination of two surface probes, tunneling\nand polarized x-ray interactions, this paper reviews our work on the nature of\nthe electronic and magnetic states at manganite surfaces and interfaces. The\ngeneral observation is that ferromagnetism is not the lowest energy state at\nthe surface or interface, which results in a suppression or even loss of\nferromagnetic order at the surface. Two cases will be discussed ranging from\nthe surface of the quasi-2D bilayer manganite\n(La$_{2-2x}$Sr$_{1+2x}$Mn$_2$O$_7$) to the 3D Perovskite\n(La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$)/SrTiO$_3$ interface.

This is in marked\ncontrast to the non-layered manganite system\n(La$_{2/3}$Sr$_{1/3}$MnO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$), whose magnetization near the interface\nis less than half the bulk value at low temperatures and decreases with\nincreasing temperature at a faster rate than the bulk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2006 20:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This suggests that\na careful study of estimation of the null is indispensable.\n  In this paper, we consider the problem of estimating a null normal\ndistribution, and a closely related problem, estimation of the proportion of\nnon-null effects. We develop an approach based on the empirical characteristic\nfunction and Fourier analysis. The estimators are shown to be uniformly\nconsistent over a wide class of parameters. Numerical performance of the\nestimators is investigated using both simulated and real data. In particular,\nwe apply our procedure to the analysis of breast cancer and HIV microarray data\nsets. The estimators perform favorably in comparison to existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2006 22:17:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}
