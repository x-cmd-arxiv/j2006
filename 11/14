The total mass fraction in subhalos is 5.3%, while the\nfraction of surface mass density in substructure within a projected distance of\n10 kpc from the halo center is 0.3%. Because of the significant contribution\nfrom the smallest resolved subhalos, these fractions have not converged yet.\nSub-substructure is apparent in all the larger satellites, and a few dark\nmatter lumps are resolved even in the solar vicinity. The number of dark\nsatellites with peak circular velocities above 10 km/s (5 km/s) is 124 (812):\nof these, 5 (26) are found within 0.1 Rvir, a region that appeared practically\nsmooth in previous simulations.

Walsh, Myers & Burton recently investigated whether such motions\nmight be observable in the earliest stages of star formation by measuring the\nrelative shifts of line-centre velocities of low- and high-density tracers of\nlow-mass star-forming cores. They found very small (~0.1 km/s) relative\nmotions. In this paper, we analyse the hydrodynamical simulation of Bate,\nBonnell & Bromm and find that it also gives small relative velocities between\nhigh-density cores and low-density envelopes, despite the fact that competitive\naccretion and dynamical interactions occur between protostars in the\nsimulation. Thus, the simulation is consistent with the observations in this\nrespect. However, we also find some differences between the simulation and the\nobservations. Overall, we find that the high-density gas has a higher velocity\ndispersion than that observed by Walsh et al. We explore this by examining the\ndependence of the gas velocity dispersion on density and its evolution with\ntime during the simulation. We find that early in the simulation the gas\nvelocity dispersion decreases monotonically with increasing density, while\nlater in the simulation, when the dense cores have formed multiple objects, the\nvelocity dispersion of the high-density gas increases. Thus, the simulation is\nin best agreement with the observations early on, before many objects have\nformed in each dense core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2006 10:43:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

To this end we\napply what we call the ``force approach'', which relies solely on the condition\nof mechanical equilibrium and turns to be in a certain sense less restrictive\nthan the more frequently used ``energy approach'', which is based on the\nminimization of a free energy functional. The main goal is to elucidate the\nadvantages and disadvantages of the force approach as compared to the energy\napproach. First, we derive a general stress-tensor formulation of the forces at\nthe interface and work out a useful analogy with 2D electrostatics in the\nparticular case of small deformations of the interface relative to its flat\nconfiguration. We apply this analogy to compute the asymptotic decay of the\neffective force between particles trapped at a fluid interface, extending the\nvalidity of previous results. Second, we address the case of deformations of a\nnon-flat interface. We compute the deformation of a spherical droplet due to\nthe electric field of a charged particle trapped at its surface and conclude\nthat the interparticle capillary force is unlikely to explain certain recent\nexperimental observations. Finally we discuss the application to a generally\ncurved interface and show as an illustrative example that a nonspherical\nparticle deposited on an interface forming a minimal surface is pulled to\nregions of larger curvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2006 16:01:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Mar 2008 11:39:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-31"}

Unconventional\nsuperconductivity is characterized by anisotropic superconducting gap\nfunctions, which may have zeros (nodes) along certain directions in the\nBrillouin zone. The nodal structure is closely related to the pairing\ninteraction, and it is widely believed that the presence of nodes is a\nsignature of magnetic or some other exotic, rather than conventional\nphonon-mediated, pairing mechanism. Therefore experimental determination of the\ngap function is of fundamental importance. However, the detailed gap structure,\nespecially the direction of the nodes, is an unresolved issue in most\nunconventional superconductors. Recently it has been demonstrated that the\nthermal conductivity and specific heat measurements under magnetic field\nrotated relative to the crystal axes are a powerful method for determining the\nshape of the gap and the nodal directions in the bulk.

This solution has a closed form expression which can be computed using\nclassical unconstrained spline smoothing techniques. This method does not\nrequire the use of quadratic or linear programming under inequality constraints\nand has therefore a low computational cost. In a one dimensional setting\nincorporating diffeomorphic constraints is equivalent to impose monotonicity.\nThus, as an illustration, it is shown that such a monotone spline can be used\nto monotonize any unconstrained estimator of a regression function, and that\nthis monotone smoother inherits the convergence properties of the unconstrained\nestimator. Some numerical experiments are proposed to illustrate its finite\nsample performances, and to compare them with another monotone estimator.

Our\nanalysis is based on a simple precondition for secure QKD in each case. In\nparticular, the legitimate users need to prove that there exists no separable\nstate (in the case of two-way QKD), or that there exists no quantum state\nhaving a symmetric extension (one-way QKD), that is compatible with the\navailable measurements results. We show that both criteria can be formulated as\na convex optimisation problem known as a semidefinite program, which can be\nefficiently solved. Moreover, we prove that the solution to the dual\noptimisation corresponds to the evaluation of an optimal witness operator that\nbelongs to the minimal verification set of them for the given two-way (or\none-way) QKD protocol. A positive expectation value of this optimal witness\noperator states that no secret key can be distilled from the available\nmeasurements results. We apply such analysis to several well-known\nsingle-photon QKD protocols under losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2006 11:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the case of potential-well traveling that is classically\nallowed, each of the successively transmitted constituents is delayed by a\nsubluminal time. When the thickness of the well is much smaller in comparision\nwith a characteristic length of the incident wave packet, the reshaped wave\npacket in transmission maintains the profile of the incident wave packet. In\nthe case of potential-barrier tunneling that is classically forbidden, though\neach of the successively transmitted constituents is delayed by a time that is\nindependent of the barrier thickness, the interference between multiple\ntransmitted constituents explains the barrier-thickness dependence of the\ntraversal time for thin barriers and its barrier-thickness independence for\nthick barriers. This manifests the nature of Hartman effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2006 14:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-30"}

Significant\nvariation of the data demonstrates genuine sample dependence of the dielectric\nfunction. We demonstrate that the Casimir force is largely determined by the\nmaterial properties in the low frequency domain and argue that therefore the\nprecise values of the Drude parameters are crucial for an accurate evaluation\nof the force. These parameters can be estimated by two different methods,\neither by fitting real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function at low\nfrequencies, or via a Kramers-Kronig analysis based on the imaginary part of\nthe dielectric function in the extended frequency range. Both methods lead to\nvery similar results. We show that the variation of the Casimir force\ncalculated with the use of different optical data can be as large as 5% and at\nany rate cannot be ignored.
