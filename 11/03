A high S/N\nspectrum in the 3-12 keV band was obtained with the XIS. We found that the\nspectrum consists of a thermal plasma, a hard power-law tail, and two Gaussian\nlines. The plasma component (kT~2.2 keV) is established from the presence of\nCaXIX and FeXXV K alpha lines as well as the absence of FeXXVI K alpha line.\nThe two Gaussian lines represent the K alpha and beta lines from iron at lower\nionization stages. Both the line centers and the intensity ratio of these two\nlines are consistent with the neutral iron. The hard power-law tail (index~0.7)\nwas found to have no pronounced iron K edge feature. In comparison with the\npublished Chandra spectra, we conclude that the thermal component is from the\nensemble of point-like sources plus thermal diffuse emission concentrated at\nthe cluster center, while the Gaussian and the hard tail components are from\nthe non-thermal diffuse emission extended in a larger scale. In the\nband-limited XIS images, the distribution of the 7.5-10.0 keV emission\nresembles that of the 6.4 keV emission. This strongly suggests that the\npower-law emission is related to the 6.4 and 7.1 keV lines in the underlying\nphysics.

These periods are thought possibly to represent the\norbital periods of close pairs of white dwarfs. In this paper we present\noptical light curves taken with the high-speed CCD camera ULTRACAM on the 4.2m\nWHT in May 2003 and August 2005 and with the VLT in November 2005. The optical\nand X-ray light curves of HM Cnc have been reported as being in anti-phase, but\nwe find that in fact the X-rays peak around 0.2 cycles after the maximum of the\noptical light, as seen also in V407 Vul. The X-ray/optical phase shifts are\nwell explained under the accreting models of the systems if most of the optical\nmodulation comes from the heated faces of the mass donors and if the X-ray\nemitting spots are positioned in advance of the mass donors, as is expected\ngiven the angular momentum of the accreting material. Some optical emission may\nalso come from the vicinity of the X-ray spot, and we further show that this\ncan explain the non-sinusoidal lightcurves of HM Cnc. The only significant\ndifference between the two stars is that V407 Vul is observed to have the\nspectrum of a G star. The variation in position on the sky of a blend of a\nvariable and a constant star can be used as a measure of their separation, and\nis sensitive to values well below the limit set by seeing. We apply \"pulsation\nastrometry\" to deduce that the G star is separated from the variable by about\n0.027'' and hence plays no role in the variability of V407 Vul. We show that\nlight travel time variations could influence the period change in V407 Vul if\nit forms a triple system with the G star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2006 15:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The physical entropy associated with Tsallis\nensemble recovers the microcanonical entropy as well and we note that the\nmicrocanonical equipartition theorem is recovered too. We are so led to\ninterpret the extensivity parameter q as a measure of the thermal bath heat\ncapacity: $q=1$ (i.e. canonical) corresponds to an infinite bath (thermalised\ncase, temperature is fixed), $q=-\\infty$ (microcanonical) corresponds to a bath\nwith null heat capacity (isolated case, energy is fixed), intermediate $q's$\n(i.e. Tsallis) correspond to the realistic cases of finite heat capacity (both\ntemperature and energy fluctuate).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2006 00:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-22"}

In this paper we attempt to build a context where it\nis possible to compare even non similar figures. Adopting Klein's view for the\nEuclidean Geometry, we defined a relation \"<=\" as: S<=T whenever there is a\nrigid motion f so that f(S) is a subset of T. This relation is not an order\nbecause there are figures (subsets of the plane) so that S<=T, T<=S and S, T\nnot geometrically equal. Our goal is to avoid this paradox and to track down\nnon-trivial classes of figures where the relation \"<=\" becomes, at least, a\npartial order. Such a class will be called a good class of figures. A\nreasonable question is whether the figures forming a good class have certain\nproperties and whether the algebra of these figures is also a good class.\nTherefore we classified the figures into those that cause the paradox mentioned\nabove and those that never cause it. The last ones are called good figures.\nAlthough simple, the definition of the good figure was difficult to handle,\ntherefore we introduced a more technical, but intrinsic and handy definition,\nthat of the strongly good figure. With these tools we constructed a new\ncontext, where we expanded our perspective about the geometric comparison not\nonly in the Euclidean but also in the Hyperbolic and in the Elliptic Geometry.\nEventually, there are still some open and quite challenging issues, which we\npresent them at the last part of the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2006 22:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We introduce a measure of portfolio sensitivity and\ntest the various risk measures by considering simulated portfolios of varying\nsizes N and for different lengths T of the time series. We find that the effect\nof noise is very strong in all the investigated cases, asymptotically it only\ndepends on the ratio N/T, and diverges at a critical value of N/T, that depends\non the risk measure in question. This divergence is the manifestation of a\nphase transition, analogous to the algorithmic phase transitions recently\ndiscovered in a number of hard computational problems. The transition is\naccompanied by a number of critical phenomena, including the divergent sample\nto sample fluctuations of portfolio weights. While the optimization under\nvariance and mean absolute deviation is always feasible below the critical\nvalue of N/T, expected shortfall and maximal loss display a probabilistic\nfeasibility problem, in that they can become unbounded from below already for\nsmall values of the ratio N/T, and then no solution exists to the optimization\nproblem under these risk measures. Although powerful filtering techniques exist\nfor the mitigation of the above instability in the case of variance, our\nfindings point to the necessity of developing similar filtering procedures\nadapted to the other risk measures where they are much less developed or\nnonexistent. Another important message of this study is that the requirement of\nrobustness (noise-tolerance) should be given special attention when considering\nthe theoretical and practical criteria to be imposed on a risk measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2006 16:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

A surprising prediction is that the differential capacitance typically\nvaries non-monotonically with the applied voltage, and thus so does the\nresponse time of an electrolytic system. In PB theory, the capacitance blows up\nexponentially with voltage, but steric effects actually cause it to decrease\nabove a threshold voltage where ions become crowded near the surface. Other\nnonlinear effects in PB theory are also strongly suppressed by steric effects:\nThe net salt adsorption by the double layers in response to the applied voltage\nis greatly reduced, and so is the tangential \"surface conduction\" in the\ndiffuse layer, to the point that it can often be neglected compared to bulk\nconduction (small Dukhin number).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2006 22:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Main result and lemma are improved","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  Network coding is often explained by using a small network model called\nButterfly. In this network, there are two flow paths, s_1 to t_1 and s_2 to\nt_2, which share a single bottleneck channel of capacity one. So, if we\nconsider conventional flow (of liquid, for instance), then the total amount of\nflow must be at most one in total, say 1/2 for each path. However, if we\nconsider information flow, then we can send two bits (one for each path) at the\nsame time by exploiting two side links, which are of no use for the liquid-type\nflow, and encoding/decoding operations at each node. This is known as network\ncoding and has been quite popular since its introduction by Ahlswede, Cai, Li\nand Yeung in 2000. In QIP 2006, Hayashi et al showed that quantum network\ncoding is possible for Butterfly, namely we can send two qubits simultaneously\nwith keeping their fidelity strictly greater than 1/2.\n  In this paper, we show that the result can be extended to a large class of\ngeneral graphs by using a completely different approach. The underlying\ntechnique is a new cloning method called entanglement-free cloning which does\nnot produce any entanglement at all. This seems interesting on its own and to\nshow its possibility is an even more important purpose of this paper. Combining\nthis new cloning with approximation of general quantum states by a small number\nof fixed ones, we can design a quantum network coding protocol which\n``simulates'' its classical counterpart for the same graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2006 12:52:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2006 09:33:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
