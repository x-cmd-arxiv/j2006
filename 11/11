Therefore, an increase\nin knowledge would lead to a decrease in the necessity of faith. Further, it is\nargued that, ideally speaking, a full knowledge of the laws of nature would\nmake obsolete any sort of religious faith and would ultimately allow a complete\ncontrol of nature by man. Since referring to nature, such views must be founded\nin the natural sciences of which physics is the most fundamental. Therefore,\nthe question whether such views are compatible with the current state of\nnatural sciences is ultimately decided in physics. Indeed, it is likely that\nthese simplistic views have their origin in the world view generated by the\nsuccesses of Newtonian physics from the middle of the 17th century until the\nbeginning of the 20th century which viewed the physical world as a type of\nmechanical clock in which the motion of the gears affect each other in a\nprecise and predictable way. In particular, the paper points out that the above\nviews are no longer supported by current physics and that abstracted world\nviews cannot be considered as part of natural sciences, but only as belief\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2006 16:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
