The magnetic tension force is expected\nto work against the main driver of the NTSI -- namely transverse momentum\ntransport. However, depending on the field strength and orientation, the\ninstability may grow. For fields aligned with the inflow, we find that the NTSI\nis suppressed only when the Alfv\\'en speed surpasses the (supersonic)\nvelocities generated along the collision interface. Even for fields\nperpendicular to the inflow, which are the most effective at preventing the\nNTSI from developing, internal structures form within the expanding slab\ninterface, probably leading to fragmentation in the presence of self-gravity or\nthermal instabilities. High Reynolds numbers result in local turbulence within\nthe perturbed slab, which in turn triggers reconnection and dissipation of the\nexcess magnetic flux. We find that when the magnetic field is initially aligned\nwith the flow, there exists a (weak) correlation between field strength and gas\ndensity. However, for transverse fields, this correlation essentially vanishes.\nIn light of these results, our general conclusion is that instabilities are\nunlikely to be erased unless the magnetic energy in clouds is much larger than\nthe turbulent energy. Finally, while our study is motivated by the scenario of\nmolecular cloud formation in colliding flows, our results span a larger range\nof applicability, from supernovae shells to colliding stellar winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2006 16:44:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

A summary is given here of some of the key developments\nover the past thirty years in the context of physics, from quantum mechanics to\nquantum field theory. Also, we discuss some of the conceptual advantages of DQ\nand how DQ may be related to algebraic quantum field theory. Additionally, our\nprevious results are summarized which includes the construction of the Fedosov\nstar-product on dS/AdS. One of the goals of these results was to verify that DQ\ngave the same results as previous analyses of these spaces. Another was to\nverify that the formal series used in the conventional treatment converged by\nobtaining exact and nonperturbative results for these spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2006 17:07:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2006 22:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The back-reaction of the quantum\nfluctuations on the bounce profiles is computed in the one-loop and Hartree\napproximations. This is to be compared with the usual semiclassical approach\nwhere one computes the profile from the classical action and determines the\none-loop correction from this profile. The computation of the fluctuation\ndeterminant is performed using a theorem on functional determinants, in\naddition we here need the Green' s function of the fluctuation operator in oder\nto compute the quantum back-reaction. As we are able to separate from the\ndeterminant and from the Green' s function the leading perturbative orders, we\ncan regularize and renormalize analytically, in analogy of standard\nperturbation theory. The iteration towards self-consistent solutions is found\nto converge for some range of the parameters. Within this range the corrections\nto the semiclassical action are at most a few percent, the corrections to the\ntransition rate can amount to several orders of magnitude. The strongest\ndeviations happen for large couplings, as to be expected.

Therefore, graph states that are either isomorphic or equivalent under\nthe local Clifford group have the same properties. In this paper, we first\nestablish a bound on the number of graph states which are neither isomorphic\nnor equivalent under the action of local Clifford group.\n  Also, we study graph states in non-binary case. We translate the action of\nlocal Clifford group, as well as measurement of Pauli operators, into\ntransformations on their associated graphs.\n  Finally, we present an efficient algorithm to verify whether two graph\nstates, in non-binary case, are locally equivalent or not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2006 17:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jun 2007 22:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}
