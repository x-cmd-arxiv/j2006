Results: The source spectral variability is\nwell-explained by additive variations, with smaller extra contributions most\nlikely arising from variable absorption. The principal varying component,\neigenvector one, is found to have a steep (photon index 2.4) power-law shape,\naffected by a low column of ionised absorption that leads to the appearance of\na soft excess. Eigenvector one varies by a factor 10 in amplitude on\ntime-scales of days and appears to have broad ionised Fe K-alpha emission\nassociated with it: the width of the ionised line is consistent with an origin\nat about 100 gravitational radii. There is also a strong component of\nnear-constant emission that dominates in the low state, whose spectrum is\nextremely hard above 1 keV, with a soft excess at lower energies, and with a\nstrong edge at Fe K but remarkably little Fe K-alpha emission.

Under the hypothesis of spherical symmetry, we assume\na double power-law expression for the global M/L ratio Upsilon(r)=\nUpsilon_0(r/r_0) ^{alpha}(1+r/r_0)^{beta}. In particular, Upsilon propto\nr^{alpha} for r/r_0<<1 so that alpha=0 mimics a constant M/L ratio in the inner\nregions, while, for (r/r_0>>1), Upsilon propto r^{alpha+beta} thus showing that\nmodels with alpha+beta=0 have an asymptotically constant M/L ratio.

Through an analysis of\nthe atomic shot noise in a set of standard absorption images, of a gas of\nfermionic 40K atoms released from an optical lattice, we find reduced\ncorrelations for distances related to the original spacing of the trapped\natoms. The detection of such quantum statistical correlations has allowed us to\ncharacterise the ordering and temperature of the Fermi gas in the lattice.\nMoreover, our findings are an important step towards revealing fundamental\nfermionic many-body quantum phases in periodic potentials, which are at the\nfocus of current research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2006 16:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}

In the latter equations, the curvature of the surface needs to be\naccounted for, which makes particle diffusion a function of membrane\nfluctuations. In our scheme these coupled dynamic equations, the membrane\nequation and the Langevin equation for the particle, are numerically integrated\nto simulate diffusion in a membrane. The simulations are used to study the\nratio of the diffusion coefficient projected on a flat plane and the\nintramembrane diffusion coefficient for the case of free diffusion.
