It is found that the two models are in agreement in terms of the\nvelocity scale (v_c ~ 1e7 cm/s) and thermodynamic fluctuation amplitudes (e.g.,\nrho'/<rho> ~ 2e-3) in the convective flow. Large fluctuations (~11%) arise in\nthe compressible model, localized to the convective boundaries, and are due to\ninternal waves excited in stable layers. Fluctuations on the several percent\nlevel are also present in the compressible model due to composition\ninhomogeneities from ongoing entrainment events at the convective boundaries.\nComparable fluctuations (with amplitudes greater than ~1%) are absent in the\nanelastic simulation because they are due to physics not included in that\nmodel. We derive an analytic estimate for the expected density fluctuation\namplitudes at convective boundaries by assuming that the pressure fluctuations\ndue to internal waves at the boundary, p_w', balance the ram pressure of the\nconvective motions, rho*v_c2. The predicted amplitudes agree well with the\nsimulation data. The good agreement between the anelastic and the compressible\nsolution within the convection zone and the agreement between the stable layer\ndynamics and analytic solutions to the non-radial wave equation indicate that\nthe compressible hydrodynamic techniques used are robust for the simulated\nstellar convection model, even at the low Mach n umbers found M~0.01.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2006 22:17:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The two stars\npreviously classified as NOV have Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic\neffective temperatures that place them inside the ZZ Ceti instability strip,\nand they were \"contaminating\" the strip as constant stars, which could indicate\nthat the instability strip was no longer a simple evolutionary stage. A pure\ninstability strip indicates that pulsation is a normal phase which all DAs must\ngo through. We used effective temperatures derived from SDSS optical spectra by\ncomparing them with model atmospheres to look for pulsators through\ntime-resolved photometry and stars previously classified as NOV. Our new\nresults indicate, but do not prove, a pure instability strip, because there are\nstill other NOV stars that need to be observed again. Additionally, we have\ndiscovered five other ZZ Ceti stars based on their effective temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2006 11:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We have shown that the overlap\nreduction function for the cross correlation between Virgo and the monopole\nmode of MiniGRAIL is very small, but a maximum was also found in the\ncorrelation at about 2710Hz, in the range of the MiniGRAIL sensitivity. In this\npaper the analysis is improved. After carefully reviewing the response function\nof interferometers to SGWs directly in the gauge of the local observer, the\nresult is used to analyze the cross correlation between the two LIGO\ninterferometers in their advanced configuration for a potential detection of\nrelic SGWs and to release a lower bound for the integration time of such a\ndetection. By using a new, frequency-dependent, overlap reduction function, a\ncomparison with previous low-frequency approximations is therefore discussed.\nThis is the first time that such a cross-correlation is computed in all the\nfrequency spectrum of relic SGWs. The computation of a better signal to noise\nratio is very important to understand if a scalar component of GWs is present\nat high frequency. With the new overlap reduction function, an order of\nmagnitude is gained concerning the integration time for detecting the relic\nSGWs' signal. This could be very important for a potential detection if\nadvanced projects further improve their sensitivity.\n  .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2006 11:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2012 13:55:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Nov 2006 14:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2007 13:31:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2007 17:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 12:23:05 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 2007 09:56:43 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 7 Nov 2008 09:40:00 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 17 Feb 2009 16:50:15 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sun, 25 Dec 2011 11:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-05-10"}

This instrument allows us to follow in\ndetail the full lifetime of coronal loops. The observed light curves suggest\nthree somewhat distinct evolutionary phases: rise, main, and decay. The\ndurations and characteristic timescales of these phases are much longer than a\ncooling time and indicate that the loop-averaged heating rate increases slowly,\nreaches a maintenance level, and then decreases slowly. This suggests that a\nsingle heating mechanism operates for the entire lifetime of the loop. For\nmonolithic loops, the loop-averaged heating rate is the intrinsic energy\nrelease rate of the heating mechanism. For loops that are bundles of\nimpulsively heated strands, it is an indication of the frequency of occurrence\nof individual heating events, or nanoflares. We show that the timescale of the\nloop-averaged heating rate is proportional to the timescale of the observed\nintensity variation. The ratios of the radiative to conductive cooling times in\nthe loops are somewhat less than 1, putting them intermediate between the\nvalues measured previously for hotter and cooler loops.

Samples\nconsisted of doped lithium fluoride TLD's that were simultaneously irradiated\nin pairs together at one location by Bremsstrahlung radiation generated by a\nVarian CLINAC unit. One of the paired TLD crystals was then mailed to Baton\nRouge and its entangled counterpart remained in Givarlais. The crystal in Baton\nRouge (master) was then subjected to thermal stimulation which elicited a\nmeasurable light emission response in the counterpart (slave) under a\nphotomultiplier in Givarlais. Highly correlated passive light emissions were\nobserved in the nonheated slave TLD while the master TLD was ramped up in\ntemperature and then allowed to cool to ambient temperature. Maximum\ncorrelations in the slave TLD light emissions were observed at the turn around\ntemperature which is the point where the master TLD temperature is allowed to\ndecrease. The experimenter in Girvalais was thus able to determine with high\naccuracy the point in time at which the master TLD heating oven was turned off\n(turn around point) without any communication between the experimenters during\nthe heating-cooling phase of the experiment. The implications of these observed\nresults are of great significance for quantum communication technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Nov 2006 01:19:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
