More HI deficient galaxies\nhave relatively smaller HI disks, a configuration that is usually attributed to\nan interaction between the ISM of the galaxy and the hot ICM. Such a result is\nsurprising since the Pegasus cluster has a low level of X-ray emission, and a\nlow velocity dispersion. The low velocity dispersion, coupled with the lack of\na dense hot ICM indicate that ram pressure stripping should not play a\nsignificant role in this environment.

Here we further explore the hypothesis that the smooth energy\nlandscape this implies, and the rapid kinetics it engenders, arises due to the\nextraordinary thermodynamic cooperativity of protein folding. Studying\nMiyazawa-Jernigan lattice polymers we find that, even under conditions where\nthe folding energy landscape is relatively optimized (designed sequences\nfolding at their temperature of maximum folding rate), the folding of\nprotein-like heteropolymers is accelerated when their thermodynamic\ncooperativity enhanced by enhancing the non-additivity of their energy\npotentials. At lower temperatures, where kinetic traps presumably play a more\nsignificant role in defining folding rates, we observe still greater\ncooperativity-induced acceleration. Consistent with these observations, we find\nthat the folding kinetics of our computational models more closely approximate\nsingle-exponential behavior as their cooperativity approaches optimal levels.\nThese observations suggest that the rapid folding of naturally occurring\nproteins is, at least in part, consequences of their remarkably cooperative\nfolding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Nov 2006 19:17:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Replication via sporulation is the replication strategy\nfor all multicellular life, and may even be observed in unicellular life (such\nas with budding yeast). We consider diploid populations replicating via one of\ntwo possible sporulation mechanisms: (1) Asexual sporulation, whereby adult\norganisms produce single-celled diploid spores that grow into adults\nthemselves. (2) Sexual sporulation, whereby adult organisms produce\nsingle-celled diploid spores that divide into haploid gametes. The haploid\ngametes enter a haploid \"pool\", where they may recombine with other haploids to\nform a diploid spore that then grows into an adult. We consider a haploid\nfusion rate given by second-order reaction kinetics. We work with a simplified\nmodel where the diploid genome consists of only two chromosomes, each of which\nmay be rendered defective with a single point mutation of the wild-type. We\nfind that the asexual strategy is favored when the rate of spore production is\nhigh compared to the characteristic growth rate from a spore to a reproducing\nadult. Conversely, the sexual strategy is favored when the rate of spore\nproduction is low compared to the characteristic growth rate from a spore to a\nreproducing adult. As the characteristic growth time increases, or as the\npopulation density increases, the critical ratio of spore production rate to\norganism growth rate at which the asexual strategy overtakes the sexual one is\npushed to higher values. Therefore, the results of this model suggest that, for\ncomplex multicellular organisms, sexual replication is favored at high\npopulation densities, and low growth and sporulation rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Nov 2006 02:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
