Brightest group and cluster galaxies (BCGs) are more likely to host a\nradio-loud AGN than other galaxies of the same stellar mass (by less than a\nfactor of two at a stellar mass of 5e11 M_sun, but over an order of magnitude\nbelow 1e11 M_sun). The distribution of radio luminosities for BCGs does not\ndepend on stellar mass, however, and is similar to that of field galaxies of\nthe same mass. Neither the radio-loud fraction nor the radio luminosity\ndistribution of BCGs depends strongly on the cluster velocity dispersion. The\nradio-AGN fraction is also studied as a function of clustercentric distance:\nonly within 0.2 r_200 do cluster galaxies exhibit an enhanced likelihood of\nradio-loud AGN activity, approaching that of the BCGs. The radio-loud AGN\nproperties of both BCGs and non-BCGs can naturally be explained if this\nactivity is fuelled by cooling from hot gas surrounding the galaxy. Using\nobservational estimates of the mechanical output of the radio jets, the\ntime-averaged energy output associated with recurrent radio source activity is\nestimated for all group/cluster galaxies. Within the cooling radius of the\ncluster, the radio-mode heating from the BCG dominates over that of all other\ngalaxies combined. The scaling between total radio-AGN energy output and\ncluster velocity dispersion is considerably shallower than the sigma^4 scaling\nof the radiative cooling rate.

In particular, this provides a\ncriterion for the preservation of supersymmetries. For bosonic symmetries\ncorresponding to diffeomorphisms, our prescription coincides with the method of\nWald et al.\n  We then illustrate these methods in the case of certain supergravity theories\nin $d=4$. In minimal AdS supergravity, the boundary conditions such that the\nsupercharges exist as Hamiltonian generators of supersymmetry transformations\nare unique within the usual framework in which the boundary metric is fixed. In\nextended ${\\mathcal N}=4$ AdS supergravity, or more generally in the presence\nof chiral matter superfields, we find that there exist many boundary conditions\npreserving ${\\mathcal N}=1$ supersymmetry for which corresponding generators\nexist. These choices are shown to correspond to a choice of certain arbitrary\nboundary ``superpotentials,'' for suitably defined ``boundary superfields.'' We\nalso derive corresponding formulae for the conserved bosonic charges, such as\nenergy, in those theories, and we argue that energy is always positive, for any\nsupersymmetry-preserving boundary conditions.

Thus, the most powerful test or other optimal procedure for\none model, e.g. recessive, may be quite inefficient if another model, e.g.\ndominant, describes the inheritance process. Rather than choose among the\nprocedures that are optimal for a particular model, it is preferable to see a\nmethod that has high efficiency across a family of scientifically realistic\nmodels. Statisticians well recognize that this situation is analogous to the\nselection of an estimator of location when the form of the underlying\ndistribution is not known. We review how the concepts and techniques in the\nefficiency robustness literature that are used to obtain efficiency robust\nestimators and rank tests can be adapted for the analysis of genetic data. In\nparticular, several statistics have been used to test for a genetic association\nbetween a disease and a candidate allele or marker allele from data collected\nin case-control studies. Each of them is optimal for a specific inheritance\nmodel and we describe and compare several robust methods. The most suitable\nrobust test depends somewhat on the range of plausible genetic models. When\nlittle is known about the inheritance process, the maximum of the optimal\nstatistics for the extreme models and an intermediate one is usually the\npreferred choice. Sometimes one can eliminate a mode of inheritance, e.g. from\nprior studies of family pedigrees one may know whether the disease skips\ngenerations or not. If it does, the disease is much more likely to follow a\nrecessive model than a dominant one. In that case, a simpler linear combination\nof the optimal tests for the extreme models can be a robust choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2006 10:54:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

After\nleaving Aristotelian metaphysics, early modern science had to cope with these\nproblems: it did so by introducing ``space'' as the seat of stability, and\n``time'' as the theater of motion. But the ontological structure present in\nthis solution remained the same. Therefore the fundamental notion `separable\nsystem', related to the notions observation and measurement, themselves related\nto the modern concepts of space and time, appears to be intrinsically\nproblematic, because it is inextricably connected to classical logic on the\nontological level. We see therefore the problems dealt with by quantum logic\nnot as merely formal, and the problem of `non-locality' as related to it,\nindicating the need to re-think the notions `system', `entity', as well as the\nimplications of the operation `measurement', which is seen here as an\napplication of classical logic (including its ontological consequences) on the\nmaterial world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2006 00:20:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-11"}
