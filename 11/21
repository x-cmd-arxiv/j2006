The obliquity, the angle between\nplanetary spin axis and its orbit normal, of a terrestrial planet is one of the\nkey factors in determining the planetary surface environments.

The\nFermi surface of the metal often has different shapes in the states well away\nfrom the critical point. It has been proposed that these differences can\npersist up to the critical point, setting up a discontinuous Fermi surface\nchange across a continuous quantum transition. We study square lattice\nantiferromagnets undergoing a continuous transition from a Neel state to a\nvalence bond solid, and examine the fate of a small density of holes in the two\nphases. Fermi surfaces of charge e, spin 1/2 quasiparticles appear in both\nphases, enclosing the usual Luttinger area. However, additional quantum numbers\ncause the area enclosed by each Fermi surface pocket to jump by a factor of 2\nacross the transition in the limit of small density. We demonstrate that the\nelectronic spectrum across this transition is described by a critical theory of\na localized impurity coupled to a 2+1 dimensional conformal field theory. This\ncritical theory also controls the more complex Fermi surface crossover at fixed\ndensity, which likely involves intermediate phases with exotic fractionalized\nexcitations.

Moreover, we prove by construction the\nexistence of a Kraus map that transforms all initial states into a predefined\ntarget state (such a process may be used, for example, in quantum information\ndilution). Thus, in sharp contrast to unitary control, Kraus-map dynamics\nallows for the design of controls which are robust to variations in the initial\nstate of the system. The general formalism is illustrated with examples of\nstate-to-state Kraus transformations in a two-level system.
