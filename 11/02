From the\nanalyses of crystal structure and magnetization measurements, it is inferred\nthat Ru should have a mixed valence of Ru3+ and Ru4+ for LSMRO with low level\nof Ru substitution, and an additional mixed valence of Ru4+ and Ru5+ with\nhigher Ru substitution. It is found that all measured physical properties\nundergo pronounced anomalies due to the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic phase\ntransition, and the observed transport properties of LSMRO can be reasonably\nunderstood from the viewpoint of polaronic transport. The Curie temperatures TC\ndetermined from the magnetization measurements are consistently higher than\nthose of the metal-insulator transitions TMI determined from the transport\nmeasurements. By replacing Mn with Ru, both TC and TMI decrease concurrently\nand the studied materials are driven toward the insulating phase with larger\nvalue of x. It is also found that the entropy change during the phase\ntransition is reduced with more Ru substitution. These observations indicate\nthat the existence of Ru has the effect of weakening the ferromagnetism and\nmetallicity of the LSMRO perovskites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2006 00:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Added reference and comment","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"hep-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  A model of dark energy and dark matter was proposed earlier by one of us\n(PQH) which involved an unbroken gauge group $SU(2)_Z$ whose coupling $\\alpha_Z\n\\equiv g_Z^2/4 \\pi\\sim O(1)$ at a scale $\\Lambda_Z \\sim 3 \\times 10^{-3} eV$\nstarting from a value within the range of the Standard Model (SM) couplings at\na high energy scale $\\sim 10^{16} GeV$. In that model, the universe is assumed\nto be presently trapped in a false vacuum with an energy density $\\sim\n\\Lambda_Z^4$. In this paper, we present a scenario in which $SU(2)_Z$ is\nunified with the SM through several steps: $E_6 \\to SU(2)_Z \\otimes SU(6) \\to\nSU(2)_Z \\otimes SU(3)_c \\otimes SU(3)_L \\otimes U(1) \\to SU(2)_Z \\otimes\nSU(3)_c \\otimes SU(2)_L \\otimes U(1)_Y$. This unification provides a rationale\nfor why the value of the $SU(2)_Z$ coupling is within the range of the SM\ncouplings at high energies. The particle content and the route of symmetry\nbreaking in this model is very different from the usual $E_6$ unification\nencountered in the literature. Several implications, in addition to the dark\nenergy, include the existence of heavy mirror particles which could be searched\nfor at future colliders such as the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Nov 2006 19:21:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Dec 2006 22:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show through the Chapman-Enskog multiscale\nanalysis that the continuum limit behavior of 3D MRT LB models corresponds to\nthat of the macroscopic dynamical equations for multiphase flow. We extend the\n3D MRT LB models developed to represent multiphase flow with reduced\ncompressibility effects. The multiphase models are evaluated by verifying the\nLaplace-Young relation for static drops and the frequency of oscillations of\ndrops. The results show satisfactory agreement with available data and\nsignificant gains in numerical stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2006 00:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

In quantum\nwalks, the qudit of walker is mixed according to the quantum coin at each time\nstep, when the walker hops to other sites. As special cases of the quantum\nwalks driven by high-dimensional quantum coins generally studied by Brun,\nCarteret, and Ambainis, we study the models obtained by choosing rotation as\nthe unitary transformation, whose matrix representations determine quantum\ncoins.

It is generally\nshown for the present models that, if $(2j+1)$ is even, the probability measure\nof limit distribution is given by a superposition of $(2j+1)/2$ terms of scaled\nKonno's density functions, and if $(2j+1)$ is odd, it is a superposition of $j$\nterms of scaled Konno's density functions and a Dirac's delta function at the\norigin. For the two-, three-, and four-component models, the probability\ndensities of limit distributions are explicitly calculated and their dependence\non the parameters of quantum coins and on the initial qudit of walker is\ncompletely determined. Comparison with computer simulation results is also\nshown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2006 08:38:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jun 2007 11:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-02"}

On the basis of the\noriginal publications (from Planck's derivation of the black-body spectrum and\nEinstein's introduction of the photons up to the results of Born, Heisenberg\nand Jordan on the quantization of a continuum) a comparative study is presented\non the first line of thoughts that led to the concept of quanta. The nature of\nthe particle-like fluctuations and the wave-like fluctuations are analysed by\nusing several approaches. With the help of the classical probability theory, it\nis shown that the infinite divisibility of the Bose distribution leads to the\nnew concept of classical poissonian photo-multiplets or to the binary\nphoto-multiplets of fermionic character. As an application, Einstein's\nfluctuation formula is derived as a sum of fermion type fluctuations of the\nbinary photo-multiplets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2006 08:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This strict relation between\nstatistical mechanics and quantum evolution can reveal deep results when the\nthermodynamic limit is considered. These results translate in a set of theorems\nproving that these effects can be effectively at work producing an emerging\nclassical world without recurring to any external entity that in some cases\ncannot be properly defined. In a many-body system has been recently shown that\nGaussian decay of the coherence is the rule with a duration of recurrence more\nand more small as the number of particles increases. This effect has been\nobserved experimentally. More generally, a theorem about coherence of bulk\nmatter can be proved. All this takes us to the conclusion that a well definite\nboundary for the quantum to classical world does exist and that can be drawn by\nthe thermodynamic limit, extending in this way the deep link between\nstatistical mechanics and quantum evolution to a high degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Nov 2006 11:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-06"}
