We also estimate the mass of the\ndegenerate torus to be of the order of $10^{-6}M_{\\odot}$, and speculate that\nthe observed optical/infrared emission from 4U0142$+$615 might be a signature\nof the thin degenerate torus we describe here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2006 21:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Sep 2007 19:54:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-27"}

The model is\ncomposed of a spherical Hernquist bulge, a Miyamoto-Nagai disc and an\nisothermal halo. As a strong lens, a spiral galaxy like the Milky Way can give\nrise to four different imaging geometries. They are (i) three images on one\nside of the galaxy centre (`disc triplets'), (ii) three images with one close\nto the centre (`core triplets'), (iii) five images and (iv) seven images.\nNeglecting magnification bias, we show that the core triplets, disc triplets\nand fivefold imaging are roughly equally likely. Even though our models contain\nedge-on discs, their image multiplicities are not dominated by disc triplets.\nThe halo has a small effect on the caustic structure, the time delays and\nbrightnesses of the images. The Milky Way model has a maximum disc (i.e., the\nhalo is not dynamically important in the inner parts). Strong lensing by nearly\nedge-on disc galaxies breaks the degeneracy between the relative contribution\nof the disc and halo to the overall rotation curve. If a spiral galaxy has a\nsub-maximum disc, then the astroid caustic shrinks dramatically in size, whilst\nthe radial caustic shrinks more modestly. This causes changes in the relative\nlikelihood of the image geometries, specifically (i) core triplets are now 9/2\ntimes more likely than disc triplets, (ii) the cross section for threefold\nimaging is reduced by a factor of 2/3, whilst (iii) the cross section for\nfivefold imaging is reduced by 1/2.

There exists a natural scale of length which\nis determined by the inverse topological mass. The topological mass is\nproportional to the square of the gauge coupling constant. In the topologically\nmassive electrodynamics the field strength locally determines the gauge\npotential up to a closed 1-form via the (anti-)self-duality equation. We\nintroduce a transformation of the gauge potential using the dual field strength\nwhich can be identified with an abelian gauge transformation.
