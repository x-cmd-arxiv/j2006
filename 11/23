Galaxies with a\nlow current star formation rate have been found to contain star clusters up to\na lower mass limit. Since stars are predominately born in clusters, and less\nmassive clusters have been found to be less likely to contain very massive\nstars, this implies that in environments or at times of low star formation, the\nstellar initial mass function does not extend to as high masses as during high\nstar formation epochs.

The prompt gamma-ray emission shows a classical FRED profile. The\noptical afterglow light curves are fitted with a broken power law, with\nalpha_1=0.35 to alpha_2=1.35 and a break time around 12 minutes after the GRB.\nAlthough contemporaneous X-ray observations were not taken, a power law\nconnection between the gamma-ray tail of the FRED temporal profile and the late\nXRT flux decay is feasible. Alternatively, if the X-ray afterglow tracks the\noptical decay, this would represent one of the first GRBs for which the\ncanonical steep-shallow-normal decay typical of early X-ray afterglows has been\nmonitored optically.

A planar distribution is indeed found that, however, does not coincide with\nthe plane found by Sawa & Fujimoto 2005. Why? The second part of this study is\ndevoted to answer this question and to find a dynamical justification for the\nplanar distribution. To this aim, we apply the Hamilton Method (Minimum Action)\nto investigate the dynamics of the two major system of the Local Group, Milky\nWay and Andromeda, under the action of external forces exerted by nearby\ngalaxies or groups external to the Local Group. We find that the planar\nistribution is fully compatible with the minimum action and that the external\nforce field is likely parallel to the plane. It pulls the galaxies of the Local\nGroup without altering their planar distribution. Special care is paid to\nevaluate the robustness of this result. Conclusion: in this paper we have\nexamined the spatial distribution of galaxies in the Local Group. They are\nconfined to a plane that can be statistically and dynamically understood as the\nresult of the Minimum Action. The planar distribution seems to be stable for a\nlarge fraction of the Hubble time. The external force field, that has likely\nbeen constant over the same time interval, does not alter the planar\ndistribution as it is nearly parallel to it.

Our\nalgorithm combines the practicality of the best single-direction traversal\nalgorithms with the worst case message complexity of $O(|E|)$, where $E$ is the\nnumber of network edges. We apply $2FACE$ to a variety of geometric routing\nalgorithms. Our simulation results indicate that bi-directional face traversal\ndecreases the latency of message delivery two to three times compared to single\ndirection face traversal. The thus selected path approaches the shortest\npossible route. This gain in speed comes with a similar message overhead\nincrease. We describe an algorithm which compensates for this message overhead\nby recording the preferable face traversal direction. Thus, if a source has\nseveral messages to send to the destination, the subsequent messages follow the\nshortest route. Our simulation results show that with most geometric routing\nalgorithms the message overhead of finding the short route by bi-directional\nface traversal is compensated within two to four repeat messages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2006 19:28:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We concentrate on three aspects of junction\ndynamics. First we consider the propagation of small amplitude waves across a\nstatic three-string junction. Then, generalizing our earlier work, we determine\nthe kinematic constraints on two colliding strings with different tensions. As\nbefore, the important conclusion is that strings do not always reconnect with a\nthird string; they can pass straight through one another (or in the case of\nnon-abelian strings become stuck in an X configuration), the constraint\ndepending on the angle at which the strings meet, on their relative velocity,\nand on the ratios of the string tensions. For example, if the two colliding\nstrings have equal tensions, then for ultra-relativistic initial velocities\nthey pass through one another. However, if their tensions are sufficiently\ndifferent they can reconnect. Finally, we consider the global properties of\njunctions and strings in a network. Assuming that, in a network, the incoming\nwaves at a junction are independently randomly distributed, we determine the\nr.m.s. velocities of strings and calculate the average speed at which a\njunction moves along each of the three strings from which it is formed. Our\nfindings suggest that junction dynamics may be such as to preferentially remove\nthe heavy strings from the network leaving a network of predominantly light\nstrings. Furthermore the r.m.s. velocity of strings in a network with junctions\nis smaller than 1/\\sqrt{2}, the result for conventional Nambu-Goto strings\nwithout junctions in Minkowski spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2006 19:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Mar 2007 08:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We consider what sort of information became available when analyzing the\ndependence of GOS upon their multipolarity, transferred momentum and energy. We\ndemonstrate the role of nondipole corrections in the small-angle fast-electron\ninelastic scattering.

In particular, we obtain the path integral kernel\nfor the linearly damped harmonic oscillator and a particle in a uniform\ngravitational field with linearly or quadratically damped motion. In each case,\nwe study the evolution of Gaussian wavepackets and discuss the characteristic\nfeatures that help us distinguish between different types of damping. For\nquadratic damping, we show that the action and equation of motion of such a\nsystem has a connection with the zero dimensional version of a currently\npopular scalar field theory. Furthermore we demonstrate that the equation of\nmotion (for quadratic damping) can be identified as a geodesic equation in a\nfictitious two-dimensional space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2006 15:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-09-20"}
