This process is so\nefficient that it is difficult to reconcile the observed cosmic abundance of\n3He with the predictions of Big Bang nucleosynthesis. In this paper we find, by\nmodeling a red giant with a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic code and a\nfull nucleosynthetic network, that mixing arises in the supposedly stable and\nradiative zone between the hydrogen-burning shell and the base of the\nconvective envelope. This mixing is due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability within a\nzone just above the hydrogen-burning shell. In this zone the burning of the 3He\nleft behind by the retreating convective envelope is predominantly by the\nreaction 3He + 3He -> 4He + 2p, a reaction which, untypically for stellar\nnuclear reactions, {\\it lowers} the mean molecular weight, leading to a local\nminimum. This local minimum leads to Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and turbulent\nmotion is generated which will continue ultimately up into the normal\nconvective envelope. Consequently material from the envelope is dragged down\nsufficiently close to the burning shell that the 3He in it is progressively\ndestroyed. Thus we are able to remove the threat that 3He production in\nlow-mass stars poses to the Big Bang nucleosynthesis of 3He. Some slow mixing\nmechanism has long been suspected, that connects the convective envelope of a\nred giant to the burning shell. It appears to be necessary to account for\nprogressive changes in the 12C/13C and 14N/12C ratios on the First Giant\nBranch. We suggest that these phenomena are also due to the\nRayleigh-Taylor-unstable character of the 3He-burning region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2006 04:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We find that variations of galaxy properties with\nenvironment are almost entirely due to the dependence of morphology and\nluminosity on environment. Because galaxy properties depend not only on\nluminosity but also on morphology, it is clear that galaxy properties cannot be\ndetermined solely by dark halo mass. When morphology and luminosity are fixed,\nother physical properties, such as color, color-gradient, concentration, size,\nvelocity dispersion, and star formation rate, are nearly independent of local\ndensity. The only feature is the sharp decrease of late type fraction above the\ncritical luminosity of about M_r=-21.3 in the morphology versus luminosity\nrelation. Weak residual dependences on environment include that of the color of\nlate-types (bluer at lower density) and of the L-sigma relation of early-types\n(larger dispersion at higher density for bright galaxies). The early-type\nfraction is a monotonically increasing function of local density and\nluminosity. The morphology-density- luminosity relation should be a key\nconstraint on galaxy formation models.

Our meeting, which had close to 300 registered\nparticipants, was broadly aimed at the large community of astronomers around\nthe world working on the formation and evolution of compact objects and\ninteracting binary systems in dense star clusters, such as globular clusters\nand galactic nuclei. Great advances have occurred in this field during the past\nfew years, including the introduction of fundamentally new theoretical\nparadigms for the formation and evolution of compact objects in binaries as\nwell as countless new discoveries by astronomers that have challenged many\naccepted models. Some of the highlights include: a nearly complete census of\nall the millisecond pulsars in 47 Tuc; first detections of many new radio\npulsars in other clusters, particularly Terzan 5; detailed studies of X-ray\nbinary populations and their luminosity functions in many galaxies and\nextragalactic globular clusters; increasing evidence for intermediate-mass\nblack holes in clusters and greatly improved theoretical understanding of their\npossible formation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2006 08:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

So, we can focus on the connected moduli M_g of\ngenus g curves. Yet, modern applications require a data variable (function) on\nsuch curves. The resulting spaces are versions, depending on our need from this\ndata variable, of Hurwitz spaces. A Nielsen class is a set defined by r \\ge 3\nconjugacy classes C in the data variable monodromy G. It gives a striking genus\nanalog.\n  Using Frattini covers of G, every Nielsen class produces a projective system\nof related Nielsen classes for any prime p dividing |G|. A nonempty (infinite)\nprojective system of braid orbits in these Nielsen classes is an infinite (G,C)\ncomponent (tree) branch. These correspond to projective systems of irreducible\n(dim r-3) components from {H(G_{p,k}(G),C)}_{k=0}^{\\infty}, the (G,C,p) Modular\nTower (MT). The classical modular curve towers {Y_1(p^{k+1})}_{k=0}^\\infty\n(simplest case: G is dihedral, r=4, C are involution classes) are an avatar.\n  The (weak) Main Conjecture says, if G is p-perfect, there are no rational\npoints at high levels of a component branch. When r=4, MT levels (minus their\ncusps) are upper half plane quotients covering the j-line. Our topics.\n  * Identifying component branches on a MT from g-p', p and Weigel cusp\nbranches using the MT generalization of spin structures.\n  * Listing cusp branch properties that imply the (weak) Main Conjecture and\nextracting the small list of towers that could possibly fail the conjecture. *\nFormulating a (strong) Main Conjecture for higher rank MTs (with examples):\nalmost all primes produce a modular curve-like system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2006 02:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In such cases echo may become independent of the\ndetails of the reversal procedure or the specifics of the coupling to the\nenvironment.
