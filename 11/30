Therefore, it\ncannot prevent the cooling catastrophe at the centre of the cluster. However,\nafter this rapid phase, where the accretion rate reaches a peak of ~0.2MSun/yr,\nthe cavities inflated by the jets become highly turbulent. The turbulent mixing\nof the shock-heated gas with the rest of the intracluster medium puts a quick\nend to this short-lived rapid-growth phase. After dropping by almost two orders\nof magnitudes, the black hole accretion rate stabilises at ~0.006MSun/yr,\nwithout significant variations for several billions of years, indicating that a\nself-regulated steady-state has been reached. This accretion rate corresponds\nto a negligible increase of the black hole mass over the age of the Universe,\nbut is sufficient to create a quasi-equilibrium state in the cluster core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2006 20:39:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2006 21:22:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The purpose of this work is\nto study the stability properties of the differentially rotating equatorial\ndisk in the pulsar's electrosphere for which the magnetic field is assumed to\nbe dipolar. In contrast to previous studies, the magnetic field is not\nrestricted to be uniform. A pseudo-spectral Galerkin method using Tchebyshev\npolynomials expansion is developed to compute the spectrum of the diocotron\ninstability in a non-neutral plasma column confined between two cylindrically\nconducting walls.

The anomalous properties of the late\nactinides stem from the competition between the itinerancy and localization of\nits f electrons, which makes the late actinides elemental strongly correlated\nmaterials. A central problem in this field is to understand the mechanism by\nwhich these materials resolve these conflicting tendencies. In this letter we\nidentify the electronic mechanisms responsible for the anomalous behaviour of\nlate actinides. We revisit the concept of valence using theoretical approach\nthat treats magnetism, Kondo screening, atomic multiplet effects, spin orbit\ncoupling and crystal field splitting on the same footing. Plutonium is found to\nbe in a rare mixed valent state, namely its ground state is a superposition of\ntwo distinct valencies.

The f7 atomic configuration of Curium is contrasted\nwith the multiple configuration manifolds present in Plutonium ground state\nwhich we characterize by a valence histogram. The balance between the Kondo\nscreening and magnetism is determined by the competition between spin orbit\ncoupling and the strength of atomic multiplets which is in turn regulated by\nthe degree of itinerancy.

Most of the evidence showing the power-law distribution is\nbased on BGP data. However, it was recently argued that since BGP collects data\nin a tree-like fashion, it only produces a sample of the degree distribution,\nand this sample may be biased. This argument was backed by simulation data and\nmathematical analysis, which demonstrated that under certain conditions a tree\nsampling procedure can produce an artificail power-law in the degree\ndistribution. Thus, although the observed degree distribution of the AS-graph\nfollows a power-law, this phenomenon may be an artifact of the sampling\nprocess. In this work we provide some evidence to the contrary. We show, by\nanalysis and simulation, that when the underlying graph degree distribution\nobeys a power-law with an exponent larger than 2, a tree-like sampling process\nproduces a negligible bias in the sampled degree distribution. Furthermore,\nrecent data collected from the DIMES project, which is not based on BGP\nsampling, indicates that the underlying AS-graph indeed obeys a power-law\ndegree distribution with an exponent larger than 2.

Here, we use a self-organized polymer (SOP) model for the\nGroEL allosteric states and a general structure-based technique to simulate the\ndynamics of allosteric transitions in two subunits of GroEL and the heptamer.\nThe $T \\to R$ transition, in which the apical domains undergo counter-clockwise\nmotion, is mediated by a multiple salt-bridge switch mechanism, in which a\nseries of salt-bridges break and form. The initial event in the $R \\to\nR^{\\prime\\prime}$ transition, during which GroEL rotates clockwise, involves a\nspectacular outside-in movement of helices K and L that results in K80-D359\nsalt-bridge formation.
