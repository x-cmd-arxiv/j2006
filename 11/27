As an illustration, the five-dimensional doubly spinning black\nrings that have two independent angular momenta are formulated in a way\nsuitable for fully nonlinear numerical method. Expanding for small second\nangular velocity, the formulation is solved perturbatively upto second order\ninvolving the backreaction from the second spin. The obtained solutions are\nregular without conical singularity, and the physical properties are discussed\nwith the phase diagram of the reduced entropy vs the reduced angular momenta.\nPossible extensions of the present approach to constructing the higher\ndimensional version of black ring and the ring with the cosmological constant\nare also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Nov 2006 12:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nwhole system is simulated with an integrated traffic simulator, that is based\non a realistic microscopic traffic model for longitudinal movements and lane\nchanges. The function of its communication module has been explicitly validated\nby comparing the simulation results with analytical calculations. By means of\nsimulations, we show that the algorithms for a congestion-front recognition,\nmessage transmission, and processing predict reliably the existence and\nposition of jam fronts for vehicle equipment rates as low as 3%. A reliable\nmode of operation already for small market penetrations is crucial for the\nsuccessful introduction of inter-vehicle communication.

Later he changed his ground, and\nfocussed instead on the point that the Copenhagen Interpretation leads to what\nEinstein saw as the abandonment of physical realism. We argue here that\nEinstein's initial intuition was perfectly sound, and that it is precisely the\nfact that quantum mechanics is a fundamentally probabilistic theory which is at\nthe root of all the controversies regarding its interpretation. Probability is\nan intrinsically logical concept. This means that the quantum state has an\nessentially logical significance. It is extremely difficult to reconcile that\nfact with Einstein's belief, that it is the task of physics to give us a vision\nof the world apprehended sub specie aeternitatis. Quantum mechanics thus\npresents us with a simple choice: either to follow Einstein in looking for a\ntheory which is not probabilistic at the fundamental level, or else to accept\nthat physics does not in fact put us in the position of God looking down on\nthings from above. There is a widespread fear that the latter alternative must\ninevitably lead to a greatly impoverished, positivistic view of physical\ntheory. It appears to us, however, that the truth is just the opposite. The\nEinsteinian vision is much less attractive than it seems at first sight.
