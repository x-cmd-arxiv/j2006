As described in a previous paper, 9 of these 20 galaxies\nhave strongly suppressed star formation and no detected emission lines. The\npresent paper concerns the 11 galaxies with detected Halpha emission, and\nstudies the origin of the line emission using the GNIRS spectra and follow-up\nobservations with SINFONI on the VLT. Based on their [NII]/Halpha ratios, the\nspatial extent of the line emission and several other diagnostics, we infer\nthat four of the eleven emission-line galaxies host narrow line active galactic\nnuclei (AGNs). The AGN host galaxies have stellar populations ranging from\nevolved to star-forming. Combining our sample with a UV-selected galaxy sample\nat the same redshift that spans a broader range in stellar mass, we find that\nblack-hole accretion is more effective at the high-mass end of the galaxy\ndistribution (~2.9x10^11 Msun) at z~2.3. Furthermore, by comparing our results\nwith SDSS data, we show that the AGN activity in massive galaxies has decreased\nsignificantly between z~2.3 and z~0. AGNs with similar normalized accretion\nrates as those detected in our K-selected galaxies reside in less massive\ngalaxies (~4.0x10^10 Msun) at low redshift. This is direct evidence for\ndownsizing of AGN host galaxies. Finally, we speculate that the typical stellar\nmass-scale of the actively accreting AGN host galaxies, both at low and at high\nredshift, might be similar to the mass-scale at which star-forming galaxies\nseem to transform into red, passive systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2006 19:56:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2006 18:28:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jun 2007 14:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 30 Jul 2007 18:14:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The ratio of tertiary/secondary\ninteraction energies serves as a proxy for non-specific cation binding: a high\nratio corresponds to a high concentration, while a low one mimics low\nconcentration. By studying the unfolding behavior of the RNA over a range of\ntemperature and tertiary/secondary energies, a three-state phase diagram\nemerges, with folded, unfolded (coil) and transient folding/unfolding tertiary\nstructure species. The thermodynamics were verified by paired folding\nsimulations in each region of the phase diagram.

However, valid and realistic methods\nto test for codivergence are not fully developed. One of the systems where\npossible codivergence has been of interest involves the large subfamily of\ntemperate grasses (Pooideae) and their endophytic fungi (epichloae). These\nwidespread symbioses often help protect host plants from herbivory and\nstresses, and affect species diversity and food web structures. Here we\nintroduce the MRCALink (most-recent-common-ancestor link) method and use it to\ninvestigate the possibility of grass-epichlo\\\"e codivergence. MRCALink applied\nto ultrametric $H$ and $P$ trees identifies all corresponding nodes for\npairwise comparisons of MRCA ages. The result is compared to the space of\nrandom $H$ and $P$ tree pairs estimated by a Monte Carlo method. Compared to\ntree reconciliation the method is less dependent on tree topologies (which\noften can be misleading), and it crucially improves on phylogeny-independent\nmethods such as {\\tt ParaFit} or the Mantel test by eliminating an extreme (but\npreviously unrecognized) distortion of node-pair sampling. Analysis of 26 grass\nspecies-epichlo\\\"e species symbioses did not reject random association of $H$\nand $P$ MRCA ages. However, when five obvious host jumps were removed the\nanalysis significantly rejected random association and supported\ngrass-endophyte codivergence. Interestingly, early cladogenesis events in the\nPooideae corresponded to early cladogenesis events in epichloae, suggesting\nconcomitant origins of this grass subfamily and its remarkable group of\nsymbionts. We also applied our method to the well-known gopher-louse data set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2006 10:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Oct 2007 19:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 17:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-28"}
