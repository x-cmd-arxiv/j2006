We investigate how the systematic\nproperties of BCGs depend on stellar mass and on their privileged location near\nthe cluster center. The groups and clusters that we study are drawn from the C4\ncatalogue of Miller et al. (2005) but we have developed improved algorithms for\nidentifying the BCG and for measuring the cluster velocity dispersion. Since\nthe SDSS photometric pipeline tends to underestimate the luminosities of large\ngalaxies in dense environments, we have developed a correction for this effect\nwhich can be readily applied to the published catalog data. We find that BCGs\nare larger and have higher velocity dispersions than non-BCGs of the same\nstellar mass, which implies that BCGs contain a larger fraction of dark matter.\nIn contrast to non-BCGs, the dynamical mass-to-light ratio of BCGs does not\nvary as a function of galaxy luminosity. Hence BCGs lie on a different\nfundamental plane than ordinary elliptical galaxies. BCGs also follow a steeper\nFaber-Jackson relation than non-BCGs, as suggested by models in which BCGs\nassemble via dissipationless mergers along preferentially radial orbits. We\nfind tentative evidence that this steepening is stronger in more massive\nclusters. BCGs have similar mean stellar ages and metallicities to non-BCGs of\nthe same mass, but they have somewhat higher alpha/Fe ratios, indicating that\nstar formation may have occurred over a shorter timescale in the BCGs. Finally,\nwe find that BCGs are more likely to host radio-loud active galactic nuclei\nthan other galaxies of the same mass, but are less likely to host an optical\nAGN. The differences we find are more pronounced for the less massive BCGs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2006 17:48:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 May 2007 20:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here, we study this phenomenon on a\nprototype model in which the network is shaped by a dynamical variable. We\ncouple the dynamics of the Bak-Sneppen evolution model with the rules of the\nso-called fitness network model for establishing the topology of a network;\neach vertex is assigned a fitness, and the vertex with minimum fitness and its\nneighbours are updated in each iteration. At the same time, the links between\nthe updated vertices and all other vertices are drawn anew with a\nfitness-dependent connection probability. We show analytically and numerically\nthat the system self-organizes to a non-trivial state that differs from what is\nobtained when the two processes are decoupled. A power-law decay of dynamical\nand topological quantities above a threshold emerges spontaneously, as well as\na feedback between different dynamical regimes and the underlying correlation\nand percolation properties of the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2006 07:58:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jun 2008 14:06:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-13"}

Upon the application of an external\nstrain rate, the material shears through the appearance of elemental slip\nevents with quadrupolar symmetry. When the energy landscape of the elemental\nconstituents is kept fixed, the slip events distribute uniformly throughout the\nsample, producing on average a uniform deformation. However, when the energy\nlandscape at different spatial positions can be rearranged dynamically to\naccount for structural relaxation, the system develops inhomogeneous\ndeformation in the form of shear bands at low shear rates, and stick-slip-like\nmotion at the shear bands for the lowest shear rates. The origin of strain\nlocalization is traced back to a region of negative correlation between strain\nrate and stress, which appears only if structural relaxation is present.

One major\ncontribution of this paper is to assess the impact of these new policies on the\ntotal replication cost.

It can be proven that the ghost Dyson-Schwinger\nequation implies the Gribov-Zwanziger horizon condition. Its relation to the\nKugo-Ojima confinement scenario is elucidated. Positivity violation for gluons\nis demonstrated, and the analytic structure of the gluon propagator is studied.\nQuark confinement is related to an infrared divergence of the quark-gluon\nvertex. It is shown that in the latter various components are non-vanishing due\nto the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry. As a result an infrared finite\nrunning coupling in the Yang-Mills sector is derived whereas the running\ncoupling related to the quark-gluon vertex is infrared divergent.\n  In Coulomb gauge QCD already the one-gluon-exchange (over-)confines. This\nleads to a vanishing quark propagator, and thus quarks are confined.\nNevertheless colour singlet quantities derived from the quark propagator are\nwell-defined. Especially the expression for the quark condensate proves that\nchiral symmetry is dynamically broken. As expected the properties of mesons can\nbe directly calculated whereas the mass of coloured diquarks diverges, and thus\ndiquarks are confined.

Contrary to special\nrelativity, aether theory does not assume that the time itself is affected by\nmotion; the reading displayed by the moving clocks results from two facts: 1/\nDue to their movement through the aether, they tick at a slower rate than in\nthe aether frame. 2/ The usual synchronization procedures generate a\nsynchronism discrepancy effect. These facts give rise to an alteration of the\nmeasurement of time which, as we shall show, exactly explains the experimental\nresults. In particular, they enable to solve an apparent paradox that special\nrelativity cannot explain (see chapter 4). When the measurement distortions are\ncorrected, the time proves to be the same in all co-ordinate systems moving\naway from one another with rectilinear uniform motion. These considerations\nstrongly support the existence of a privileged aether frame. The consequences\nconcern special relativity (SR) as well as general relativity (GR) which is an\nextension of SR. We should note that Einstein himself became conscious of the\nnecessity of the aether from 1916, in contrast with conventional relativity.\nYet the model of aether presented here differs from Einsein in that it assumes\nthe existence of an aether drift, in agreement with the discoveries of G.F.\nSmoot and his co-workers listed in Smoot Nobel Lecture, December 8th 2006.\nAlthough it makes reference to previous studies, this text remains\nself-sufficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2006 17:20:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2006 12:38:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Apr 2008 10:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 11 Jun 2008 07:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2008 18:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-14"}

In order\nto address its intrinsically nonlinear time-asymptotic behavior, a Monte Carlo\ncode was built to estimate its equilibrium statistical mechanics in both the\ncanonical and microcanonical ensembles. First the single wave model is\nconsidered in the cold beam/plasma instability and in the O'Neil setting for\nnonlinear Landau damping. O'Neil's threshold, that separates nonzero\ntime-asymptotic wave amplitude states from zero ones, is associated to a second\norder phase transition. These two studies provide both a testbed for the Monte\nCarlo canonical and microcanonical codes, with the comparison with exact\ncanonical results, and an opportunity to propose quantitative results to\nlongstanding issues in basic nonlinear plasma physics. Then the properly\nspeaking weak turbulence framework is considered through the case of a large\nspectrum of waves. Focusing on the small coupling limit, as a benchmark for the\nstatistical mechanics of weak Langmuir turbulence, it is shown that Monte Carlo\nmicrocanonical results fully agree with an exact microcanonical derivation. The\nwave spectrum is predicted to collapse towards small wavelengths together with\nthe escape of initially resonant particles towards low bulk plasma thermal\nspeeds.

Only when\ninterneurons with complex receptive fields were included, similar to those\nfound recently in cat primary visual cortex (Hirsch et al, 2003), did the\nnetwork behave appropriately. A critical feature in the model was that complex\ninterneurons projected to simple interneurons but the simple interneurons did\nnot project back to them. The network was switched from the non-attended state\nto the attended state by increasing the depolarization of the complex\ninterneurons. In addition to contrast-invariant orientation tuning, the model\nreproduced the following experimental results: (1) the gamma-frequency range\ncoherence between the estimated local field potential (eLFP) and spike trains\nof excitatory cells was higher in the attended state than in the non-attended\nstate, but the firing rates of the excitatory cells did not vary between\nstates; (2) the gamma-frequency-range power in the eLFP increased with\ncontrast.
