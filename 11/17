We show that magnification\nbias, which is the inevitable modulation of the foreground number counts by\ngravitational lensing, alters both the shape and amplitude of the observed ISW\nsignal. This is true especially at high redshifts because (1) the intrinsic\ngalaxy-temperature signal diminishes greatly back in the matter dominated era,\n(2) the lensing efficiency increases with redshift and (3) the number count\nslope generally steepens with redshift in a magnitude limited sample. At z >~\n2, the magnification-temperature correlation dominates over the intrinsic\ngalaxy-temperature correlation and causes the observed ISW signal to increase\nwith z, despite dark energy subdominance -- a result of the fact that\nmagnification probes structures between the observer and the sources. Ignoring\nmagnification bias can then lead to erroneous conclusions about dark energy.\nWhile the lensing modulation opens up an interesting high z window for ISW\nmeasurements, high z measurements are not expected to add much new information\nto low z ones if dark energy is the cosmological constant. This is because\nlensing introduces significant covariance across redshifts. The most compelling\nreason to pursue high z ISW measurements is to look for a potential surprise\nsuch as early dark energy domination or the signature of modified gravity.

In this paper, we propose a project that would\ntake the maximum benefit of Dome C in Antarctica by performing two surveys, in\nthe wavelength range from 1-5 micron, complementary to SNAP space surveys. The\nfirst one over 1000 sq. deg. (1 KdF) for 4 years and the second one over 15 sq.\ndeg (SNAP-IR) for the next 4 years at the same time as SNAP 0.35-1.7 microns\nsurvey. By using a Ground-Layer Adaptive Optics system, we would be able to\nrecover, at the ice level and over at least half a degree in radius, the 300\nmas angular resolution available above the 30-m high turbulent layer. Such a\nsurvey, combining a high angular resolution with high sensitivities in the NIR\nand MIR, should also play the role of a pre-survey for JWST and ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 11:55:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The inertia property of matter is discussed in terms of a type of induction\nlaw related to the extended charged particle's own vector potential. Our\napproach is based on the Lagrangian formalism of canonical momentum writing\nNewton's second law in terms of the vector potential and a development in terms\nof obtaining retarded potentials, that allow an intuitive physical\ninterpretation of its main terms. This framework provides a clear physical\ninsight on the physics of inertia. It is shown that the electron mass has a\ncomplete electromagnetic origin and the covariant equation obtained solves the\n\"4/3 mass paradox\". This provides a deeper insight into the significance of the\nmain terms of the equation of motion. In particular a force term is obtained\nfrom the approach based on the continuity equation for momentum that represents\na drag force the charged particle feels when in motion relatively to its own\nvector potential field lines. Thus, the time derivative of the particle's\nvector potential leads to the acceleration inertia reaction force and is\nequivalent to the Schott term responsible for the source of the radiation\nfield. We also show that the velocity dependent term of the particle's vector\npotential is connected with the relativistic increase of mass with velocity and\ngenerates a stress force that is the source of electric field lines\ndeformation. This understanding broadens the possibility to manipulate inertial\nmass and potentially suggests some mechanisms for possible applications to\nelectromagnetic propulsion and the development of advanced space propulsion\nphysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 08:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The radiation filter has been designed\nby using a silicon single crystal cooled by liquid nitrogen and a bismuth\ncrystal.

Experimental measurements of the neutron\nbeam characteristics have been performed by using bare and cadmium covered gold\nfoils and wires.

Protein-ligand docking is about\ncomputing the binding energy of a protein target to a library of potential\ndrugs using a scoring algorithm. Previous deployments were either limited to\none cluster, to grids of clusters in the tightly protected environment of a\npharmaceutical laboratory or to pervasive grids. The first large scale docking\nexperiment ran on the EGEE grid production service from 11 July 2005 to 19\nAugust 2005 against targets relevant to research on malaria and saw over 41\nmillion compounds docked for the equivalent of 80 years of CPU time. Up to\n1,700 computers were simultaneously used in 15 countries around the world.\nIssues related to the deployment and the monitoring of the in silico docking\nexperiment as well as experience with grid operation and services are reported\nin the paper. The main problem encountered for such a large scale deployment\nwas the grid infrastructure stability. Although the overall success rate was\nabove 80%, a lot of monitoring and supervision was still required at the\napplication level to resubmit the jobs that failed.

Unfortunately body mass cannot be easily measured for\nmany species, because of the logistical difficulties involved in actually\ncatching and weighing them. This is particularly true for sea turtles which are\nlarge vertebrates that spend most of their life at sea. Here we developed a\ngeneral linear model to predict body mass from 17 morphometric measurements\nobtained from 49 leatherback turtles nesting in Awala Yalimapo beach, French\nGuiana, South America. A stepwise backward analysis removing independent\nparameters with P > 0.001 indicated that body mass can be estimated with 93%\naccuracy by Body Mass (kg) = - 709.146 + 3.391MedianBodyCirc (cm) + 2.664SCCL\n(cm), where SCCL is the standard curvilinear carapace length and MedianBodyCirc\nis body circumference at half of SCCL. A sensibility test showed that this\nparsimonious model is robust, as estimated body mass may change by 0.7-1.3% for\n1-2 cm changes in SCCL, by 0.9-1.7% for 1-2 cm changes in circumference.\nLeatherback turtles from French Guiana were larger and heavier than in all\nother nesting sites studied so far, suggesting either that gravid leatherbacks\nfeed during the nesting season in French Guiana, and/or that this species may\nexhibits site-specific growth strategies. Further studies are required to test\nthese hypotheses, including implementation of similar simple models for other\nnesting populations, in order to better understand the life history of this\nendangered species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 15:06:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The leatherbacks\ndispersed over the continental shelf, ranging from the coastal zone to the\nshelf break and moved over 546.2 $\\pm$ 154.1 km (mean $\\pm$ SD) in waters of\nFrench Guiana and neighbouring Surinam.

Inter-nesting intervals could be divided\ninto two phases: during the first 75% of the time turtles spent at sea, they\ndived on average 47 min h-1 before showing a lower and more variable diving\neffort as they came back to the shore. The extended movements of leatherbacks\nand the fine analysis of dive shapes suggest that in French Guiana leatherbacks\nmay feed during the inter-nesting interval, probably to compensate for the\nenergy costs associated with reproduction.

This is a quantum version of the Bhattacharyya inequality in the\nclassical statistical estimation. Because of non-commutativity of operator\nmultiplication, we obtain three different types of lower bounds; Type S, Type R\nand Type L. If the parameter is a real number, the Type S bound is useful. If\nthe parameter is complex, the Type R and L bounds are useful. As an\napplication, we will consider estimation of polynomials of the complex\namplitude of the quantum Gaussian state. For the case where the amplitude lies\nin the real axis, a uniformly optimum estimator for the square of the amplitude\nwill be derived using the Type S bound. It will be shown that there is no\nunbiased estimator uniformly optimum as a polynomial of annihilation and/or\ncreation operators for the cube of the amplitude. For the case where the\namplitude does not necessarily lie in the real axis, uniformly optimum\nestimators for holomorphic, antiholomorphic and real-valued polynomials of the\namplitude will be derived.
