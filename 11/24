As the\nstar illuminates the innermost particles, which are immersed in gas at the\nsublimation edge, these particles are subject to a photophoretic force. We\nexamine the motion of dust particles at the inner edge of protoplanetary disks\ndue to photophoretic drag. We find that, in a laminar disk, photophoretic drag\nincreases the size of the inner hole after accretion onto the central body has\nbecome subdued. This region within the hole becomes an optically transparent\nzone containing gas and large dusty particles (>>10 cm), but devoid of, or\nstrongly depleted in, smaller dust aggregates. Photophoresis can clear the\ninner disk of dust out to 10 AU in less than 1 Myr. At late times, the edge\nreaches a stable equilibrium between inward drift and photophoretic outward\ndrift, at a distance of some tens of AU. Eventually, the edge will move inwards\nagain as the disk disperses, shifting the equilibrium position back from about\n40 AU to below 30 AU in 1-2 Myr in the disk model. In a turbulent disk,\ndiffusion can delay the clearing of a disk by photophoresis. Smaller and/or\nage-independent holes of radii of a few AU are also possible outcomes of\nturbulent diffusion counteracting photophoresis. This outward and then inward\nmoving edge marks a region of high dust concentration.

Disk-forming wind models have, however, been found to be insufficient in\nreproducing the observed dust emission. This problem arises due to the severe\nassumption that, as for classical Be stars, the near-infrared excess emission\noriginates in the disk. Modeling of the free-free and free-bound emission\ntherefore results in an upper limit for the disk mass loss rate, hampering dust\ncondensation in the disk. We propose a revised scenario for the non-spherical\nwinds of B[e] supergiants: a normal B-type line-driven polar wind and an\noutflowing disk-forming wind that is neutral in hydrogen at, or very close to\nthe stellar surface. We concentrate on the pole-on seen LMC B[e] supergiant\nR126 and calculate the line luminosities of the optical [OI] emission lines\nwith an outflowing disk scenario. In addition, we compute the free-free and\nfree-bound emission from a line-driven polar wind and model the spectral energy\ndistribution in the optical and near-infrared. Good fits to the [OI] line\nluminosities are achieved for an outflowing disk that is neutral in hydrogen\nright from the stellar surface. Neutral thereby means that hydrogen is ionized\nby less than 0.1%. Consequently, the free-free and free-bound emission cannot\n(dominantly) arise from the disk and cannot limit the disk mass loss rate. The\nhydrogen neutral outflowing disk scenario therefore provides an ideal\nenvironment for efficient dust formation. The spectral energy distribution in\nthe optical and near-infrared range can be well fitted with the stellar\ncontinuum plus free-free and free-bound emission from the polar line-driven\nwind.

In this paper, we provide an attempt to formalize this gluing scheme\nby studying transition functions that join approximate solutions together. In\nparticular, we propose certain sufficient conditions on these functions and\nproof that these conditions guarantee that the joined solution still satisfies\nthe Einstein equations to the same order as the approximate ones.

The resulting Debye-screened potential could\nbe used in models that attempt to describe the ``melting'' of heavy quarkonium\nat high temperatures. We show, in particular, that the potential develops an\nimaginary part, implying that thermal effects generate a finite width for the\nquarkonium peak in the dilepton production rate. For quarkonium with a very\nheavy constituent mass M, the width can be ignored for T \\lsim g^2 M/12\\pi,\nwhere g^2 is the strong gauge coupling; for a physical case like bottomonium,\nit could become important at temperatures as low as 250 MeV. Finally, we point\nout that the physics related to the finite width originates from the\nLandau-damping of low-frequency gauge fields, and could be studied\nnon-perturbatively by making use of the classical approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Nov 2006 16:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Mar 2007 14:02:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

Given the different divisions of a composite system into\n\"subsystems\", the Hamiltonian of the system may perform in general\nnon-equivalent quantum computations. Redefinition of \"subsystems\" of a\ncomposite system may be regarded as a method for avoiding decoherence in the\nquantum hardware. In principle, all the notions refer to a composite system as\nsimple as the hydrogen atom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2006 13:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-02-21"}

Phys. A: Math. Gen. 38 (2005) p. 6051- 6064","doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  We derive an upper bound on the action of a direct product of two quantum\nmaps (channels) acting on multi-partite quantum states. We assume that the\nindividual channels $\\Lambda_j$ affect single-particle states so, that for an\narbitrary input $\\rho_j$, the distance $D_j (\\Lambda_j [ \\rho_j ], \\rho_j)$\nbetween the input $\\rho_j$ and the output $\\Lambda_j [ \\rho_j ]$ of the channel\nis less than $\\epsilon$. Given this assumption we show that for an arbitrary\n{\\em separable} two-partite state $\\rho_{12}$ the distance between the input\n$\\rho_{12}$ and the output $\\Lambda_1\\otimes\\Lambda_2[\\rho_{12} ]$ fulfills the\nbound $D_{12} (\\Lambda_1 \\otimes \\Lambda_2 [ \\rho_{12} ], \\rho_{12}) \\leq\n\\sqrt{2+ 2 \\sqrt{(1-1/d_1)(1-1/d_2)}} \\epsilon$ where $d_1$ and $d_2$ are\ndimensions of first and second quantum system respectively. On the contrary,\nentangled states are transformed in such a way, that the bound on the action of\nthe local channels is $D_{12} (\\Lambda_1 \\otimes \\Lambda_2 [ \\rho_{12} ],\n\\rho_{12}) \\leq 2 \\sqrt{2 - 1/d} \\: \\epsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of\nthe smaller of the two quantum systems passing through the channels. Our\nresults show that the fundamental distinction between the set of separable and\nthe set of entangled states results into two different bounds which in turn can\nbe exploited for a discrimination between the two sets of states. We generalize\nour results to multi-partite channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2006 15:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
