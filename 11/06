Our\ndeeper maps allow us to see that the core mass function (CMF) turns over at ~\n1.3 Mo, about a factor of 4 higher than our completeness limit.

We explicitly\nderived analytic approximations to the low frequency double Compton emission\ncoefficient for initial monochromatic photons and Wien spectra. We show that\ncombining the analytic approximations given in this paper, an accuracy of\nbetter than 5% over a very broad range of temperatures and under various\nphysical conditions can be achieved. The double Compton emissivity strongly\ndepends on the ratio of the incoming photon and electron energies: for hard\nphotons and cold electrons the emission is strongly suppressed compared to the\ncase of similar photon and electron energy, whereas in the opposite situation,\ni.e. hot electrons and soft initial photons, the emission is enhanced. For\nphotons and electrons close to thermodynamic equilibrium the double Compton\nemissivity increases less rapidly with temperature than in the Lightman-Thorne\napproximation and the corrections exceed ~10% for temperatures above 4 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Nov 2006 14:01:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 May 2007 13:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

It is manifest that the functional\ndecomposition of switching function actually exploits the same idea and serves\na similar purpose as database normalization. Partitions play an important role\nin the decomposition. The interdependency of two partitions can be represented\nby a bipartite graph. We demonstrate that both FD and MVD can be represented by\nbipartite graphs with specific topological properties, which are delineated by\npartitions of minterms.

Solving weighted Max-SAT is an\nimportant problem from both a theoretical and a practical point of view.

The stationary type distribution of the reversed process, the so-called\nancestral distribution, turns out as a key for the study of mutation-selection\nbalance. This balance can be expressed in the form of a variational principle\nthat quantifies the respective roles of reproduction and mutation for any\npossible type distribution. It shows that the mean growth rate of the\npopulation results from a competition for a maximal long-term growth rate, as\ngiven by the difference between the current mean reproduction rate, and an\nasymptotic decay rate related to the mutation process; this tradeoff is won by\nthe ancestral distribution.\n  Our main application is the quasispecies model of sequence evolution with\nmutation coupled to reproduction but independent across sites, and a fitness\nfunction that is invariant under permutation of sites.

Enterocyte\nwidth increases by 23% within 24 h postfeeding, inducing significant increases\nin villus length and intestinal mass.

Contributing to enterocyte\nhypertrophy is the cellular accumulation of lipid droplets at the tips and\nedges of the villi of the proximal and middle small intestine, but which were\nabsent in the distal small intestine. At 3 days postfeeding, conventional and\nenvironmental scanning electron microscopy revealed cracks and lipid extrusion\nalong the narrow edges of the villi and at the villus tips. Transmission\nelectron microscopy demonstrated the rapid postprandial lengthening of\nenterocyte microvilli, increasing 4.8-fold in length within 24 h, and the\nmaintaining of that length through digestion.
