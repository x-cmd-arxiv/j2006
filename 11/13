The OM data indicate that\naccreting stars are statistically brighter in the U band than non-accreting\nstars after correction for extinction, and have U-band excesses, most likely\ndue to accretion. The OM emission of accreting stars is variable, probably due\nto accretion spots, but it does not correlate with the X-ray light curve,\nsuggesting that accretion does not contribute significantly to the X-ray\nemission of most accreting stars. In some cases, flares were detected in both\nX-ray and OM light curves and followed a Neupert effect pattern, in which the\noptical/ultraviolet emission precedes the X-ray emission of a flare, whereas\nthe X-ray flux is proportional to the integral of the optical flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Nov 2006 17:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-08"}

Still, it would be\ninteresting to get as much information as possible from the measured\nlightcurves. From high resolution images we know that the recorded quasar\nimages are often blends and that the corresponding time series are not pure\nshifted replicas of the source variability. In this paper we will develop an\nalgorithm to unscramble this kind of blended data.\n  The proposed method is based on a simple idea. We use one of the photometric\ncurves, which is supposedly a simple shifted replica of the source curve, to\nbuild different artificial combined curves. Then we compare these artificial\ncurves with the blended curves. Proper solutions for a full set of time delays\nare then obtained by varying free input parameters and estimating statistical\ndistances between the artificial and blended curves.\n  We performed a check of feasibility and applicability of the new algorithm.\nFor numerically generated data sets the time delay systems were recovered for a\nwide range of setups. Application of the new algorithm to the classical double\nquasar QSO 0957+561 A,B lightcurves shows a clear splitting of one of the\nimages. This is an unexpected result and extremely interesting, especially in\nthe context of the recent controversy about the exact time delay value for the\nsystem.\n  The proposed method allows us to properly analyse the data from low\nresolution observations that have long time coverages.

He also gave an\nexample of a eigenfunction high in the spectrum with a minimal number of nodal\ndomains, thus excluding the existence of a non-trivial lower bound. An analogue\nof Sturm's result for discretizations of the interval was discussed by\nGantmacher and Krein. The discretization of an interval is a graph of a simple\nform, a chain-graph. But what can be said about more complicated graphs? It has\nbeen known since the early 90s that the nodal count for a generic eigenfunction\nof the Schrodinger operator on quantum trees (where each edge is identified\nwith an interval of the real line and some matching conditions are enforced on\nthe vertices) is exact too: zeros of the N-th eigenfunction divide the tree\ninto exactly N subtrees. We discuss two extensions of this result in two\ndirections.

We first present reduction theorems for optimal unambiguous\ndiscrimination of two generic density matrices. We show that this problem can\nbe reduced to that of two density matrices that have the same rank $r$ in a\n2$r$-dimensional Hilbert space. These reduction theorems also allow us to\nreduce USD problems to simpler ones for which the solution might be known. As\nan application, we consider the unambiguous comparison of $n$ linearly\nindependent pure states with a simple symmetry. Moreover, lower bounds on the\noptimal failure probability have been derived. For two mixed states they are\ngiven in terms of the fidelity. Here we give tighter bounds as well as\nnecessary and sufficient conditions for two mixed states to reach these bounds.\nWe also construct the corresponding optimal measurement. With this result, we\nprovide analytical solutions for unambiguously discriminating a class of\ngeneric mixed states. This goes beyond known results which are all reducible to\nsome pure state case. We however show that examples exist where the bounds\ncannot be reached. Next, we derive properties on the rank and the spectrum of\nan optimal USD measurement. This finally leads to a second class of exact\nsolutions. Indeed we present the optimal failure probability as well as the\noptimal measurement for unambiguously discriminating any pair of geometrically\nuniform mixed states in four dimensions. This class of problems includes for\nexample the discrimination of both the basis and the bit value mixed states in\nthe BB84 QKD protocol with coherent states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Nov 2006 20:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

I have found that the eigenvalues\nof the hamiltonian of the oscillator with the limiting (approachissimo)\nharmonic potential (~ p(x)2) maps the zeros of the Riemann function height up\nin the Riemann line. This is the potential created by the field of J(x) that is\nthe Riemann generator of the prime number counting function, p(x), that in turn\ncan be defined by an integral transformation of the Riemann zeta function. This\nplays the role of the spring strength of the quantum limiting harmonic\noscillator. The number theory meaning of this result is that the roots height\nup of the zeta function are the eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian whose potential is\nthe number of primes squared up to a given x. Therefore this may prove the\nnever published Hilbert-Polya conjecture. The conjecture is true but does not\nimply the truth of the Riemann hypothesis.
