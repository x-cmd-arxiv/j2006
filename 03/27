The Fe5270 and Fe5335 indices show\nonly very weak trends with radius. Using a total of twelve indices, the pattern\nof cluster-centric gradients is considered in light of their different\ndependences on stellar age and chemical composition. The measured gradients for\nall twelve indices can be reproduced by a model in which red-sequence galaxies\nat ~1 R_200 have on average younger ages (by 15+/-4%) and lower alpha-element\nabundance ratios (by 10+/-2%), than galaxies of the same velocity dispersion\nbut located near the cluster centre.

The\ncluster-centric age and alpha/Fe gradients are in the sense expected if\ngalaxies in the cluster core were accreted at an earlier epoch than those at\nlarger radii, and if this earlier accretion contributed to an earlier cessation\nof star formation.

The star-formation process is the outcome of the complex dynamics\nof interstellar gas involving non-linear interactions of turbulence, gravity,\nmagnetic field and radiation. The evolution of protostellar condensations, from\nthe moment they are assembled by turbulent flows to the time they reach stellar\ndensities, spans an enormous range of scales, resulting in a major\ncomputational challenge for simulations. Since the previous Protostars and\nPlanets conference, dramatic advances in the development of new numerical\nalgorithmic techniques have been successfully implemented on large scale\nparallel supercomputers. Among such techniques, Adaptive Mesh Refinement and\nSmooth Particle Hydrodynamics have provided frameworks to simulate the process\nof low-mass star formation with a very large dynamic range.

The result extends to Hardy-Orlicz spaces contained in the scale of\nclassical Hardy spaces $H^p$, $p>0$. For the Smirnov and the Nevanlinna\nclasses, interpolating sequences have been characterized in a recent paper in\nterms of the existence of harmonic majorants (quasi-bounded in the case of the\nSmirnov class). Since the Smirnov class can be regarded as the union over all\nHardy-Orlicz spaces associated with a so-called strongly convex function, it is\nnatural to ask how the condition changes from the Carleson condition in\nclassical Hardy spaces to harmonic majorants in the Smirnov class. The aim of\nthis paper is to narrow down this gap from the Smirnov class to ``big''\nHardy-Orlicz spaces. More precisely, we characterize interpolating sequences\nfor a class of Hardy-Orlicz spaces that carry an algebraic structure and that\nare strictly bigger than $\\bigcup_{p>0} H^p$. It turns out that the\ninterpolating sequences are again characterized by the existence of\nquasi-bounded majorants, but now the weights of the majorants have to be in\nsuitable Orlicz spaces. The existence of harmonic majorants in such Orlicz\nspaces will also be discussed in the general situation.

Peer social networks appear to be mainly composed of pure\nresource providers that guarantee high resource availability and reliability of\nP2P systems. The major peers that both provide and request resources are only a\nsmall fraction. The connectivity between peers, including undirected, directed\n(out and in) and weighted connections, is scale-free and the social networks of\nall peers and major peers are small world networks. The analysis also confirms\nthat peer social networks show in general disassortative correlations, except\nthat active providers are connected between each other and by active\nrequesters. The study presented in this paper gives a better understanding of\npeer relationships in resource sharing, which may help a better design of\nfuture P2P networks and open the path to the study of transport processes on\ntop of real P2P topologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2006 10:11:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

All the essential physical\nparameters are obtained as epoch dependent functions all in closed form. The\nequations of state are obtained for total density, non-dark energy density and\ndark energy density. An interpretation of the structure involving a dark energy\nmass distribution that is twice the usual value is shown to clarify greatly the\nphysical significance of the mathematics. It is asserted that the astronomer's\nmeasurements together with the mathematical model proves that the universe is\npermeated uniformly with a positive mass density that caries a negative\ngravitational constant, -G, characteristic. This mass component is identified\nwith the dark energy content of the universe that has been postulated to\nexplain the observed acceleration. Another result implied by the model is that\nthere is twice the amount of dark energy that is usually considered to be\npresent. This last point is analysed in more detail in appendix 1 using\nEinstein's field equations. Five additional appendices, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in\nwhich isothermal gravitational dark matter equilibrium and the galactic\nrotations curve flatness problem are examined in detail.
