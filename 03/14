Rather than relying on prior knowledge about the\nforeground components, we first extract the necessary information about them\ndirectly from the microwave sky maps by taking differences of temperature maps\nat different frequencies. These difference maps, which we refer to as internal\ntemplates, consist only of linear combinations of galactic foregrounds and\nnoise, with no CMB component. We obtain the foreground cleaned maps by fitting\nthese internal templates to, and subsequently subtracting the appropriately\nscaled contributions of them from, the CMB dominated channels. The fitting\noperation is performed in wavelet space, making the analysis feasible at high\nresolution with only a minor loss of precision. Applying this procedure to the\nWMAP data, we obtain a power spectrum that matches the spectrum obtained by the\nWMAP team at the signal dominated scales. Finally, we have revisited previous\nclaims about a north-south power asymmetry on large angular scales, and confirm\nthat these remain unchanged with this completely different approach to\nforeground separation. This also holds when fitting the foreground contribution\nindependently to the northern and southern hemisphere indicating that the\nasymmetry is unlikely to have its origin in different foreground properties of\nthe hemispheres. This conclusion is further strengthened by the lack of any\nobserved frequency dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2006 20:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this\nletter, we predict dust signatures and propose a potential observational test\nof the physics of dust formation in brown dwarf atmosphere based on the\nspectral features of the different solid components predicted by dust formation\ntheory. A momentum method for the formation of dirty dust grains (nucleation,\ngrowth, evaporation, drift) is used in application to a static brown dwarf\natmosphere structure to compute the dust grain properties, in particular the\nheterogeneous grain composition and the grain size. Effective medium and Mie\ntheory are used to compute the extinction of these spherical grains. Dust\nformation results in grains whose composition differs from that of grains\nformed at equilibrium. Our kinetic model predicts that solid amorphous SiO2[s]\n  (silica) is one of the most abundant solid component followed by amorphous\n  MgSiO4[s] and MgSiO3[s], while SiO2[s] is absent in equilibrium models\nbecause it is a metastable solid.

The angular\nvelocity time correlation function also exhibits a rather pronounced power law\ndecay near the I-N boundary.

In the special case of four staggered fields (four flavors,\nnF=4), I show here that certain assumptions about analyticity and phase\nstructure imply the validity of this procedure for representing the rooting\ntrick in the chiral sector. I start from the observation that, when the four\nflavors are degenerate, the fourth root simply reduces nF=4 to nF=1. One can\nthen treat nondegenerate quark masses by expanding around the degenerate limit.\nWith additional assumptions on decoupling, the result can be extended to the\nmore interesting cases of nF=3, 2, or 1. A apparent paradox associated with the\none-flavor case is resolved. Coupled with some expected features of unrooted\nstaggered quarks in the continuum limit, in particular the restoration of taste\nsymmetry, schpt then implies that the fourth-root trick induces no problems\n(for example, a violation of unitarity that persists in the continuum limit) in\nthe lowest energy sector of staggered lattice QCD. It also says that the theory\nwith staggered valence quarks and rooted staggered sea quarks behaves like a\nsimple, partially-quenched theory, not like a \"mixed\" theory in which sea and\nvalence quarks have different lattice actions.

A new analysis shows that a high p_T suppression of\nsingle electrons is observed in Au + Au collisions at 200 GeV. This suppression\nsuggests that heavy quarks lose significant energy in the medium. A weak\nrapidity dependence is seen in J/psi yields from d + Au data, which can be\ninterpreted as a cold matter effect. We report also the results of a\nmeasurement of the spin alignment of the J/psi in the p_T range around 1.5\nGeV/c.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2006 11:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-08-14"}

A\nskeptical observer should subject the estimate to a test that guarantees that a\nself-interested experimentalist will report the true state as accurately as\npossible. We also find a non-asymptotic, operational interpretation of the\nquantum relative entropy function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2006 03:16:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
