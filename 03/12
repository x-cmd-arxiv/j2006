Specifically, we argue\nthat self-replication of von Neumann's universal constructors holds a close\nsimilarity to circular computational processes of universal computers that\nappear in Turing's original proof of the undecidability of the halting problem.\nThe result indicates the possibility of reinterpreting a self-replicating\nbiological organism as embodying an attempt to solve the halting problem for a\n{\\em diagonal} input in the context of construction. This attempt will never be\ncompleted because of the indefinite cascade of self-computation/construction,\nwhich accounts for the undecidability of the halting problem and also agrees\nwell with the fact that life has maintained its reproductive activity for an\nindefinitely long period of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2006 03:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 2007 21:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Nov 2007 06:02:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

The stability\nof the solitons is studied by means of direct simulations, and, in a part,\nanalytically, using linearized equations for small perturbations. Global\nstability of the solitons is considered by means of the energy comparison. As a\nresult, ground-state and metastable soliton states of the FM and polar types\nare identified. For the special integrable version of the model, we develop the\nDarboux transformation (DT). As an application of the DT, analytical solutions\nare obtained that display full nonlinear evolution of the modulational\ninstability (MI) of a continuous-wave (CW) state seeded by a small spatially\nperiodic perturbation. Additionally, by dint of direct simulations, we\ndemonstrate that solitons of both the polar and FM types, found in the\nintegrable system, are structurally stable, i.e., they are robust under random\nchanges of the relevant nonlinear coefficient in time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2006 07:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
