The system is equilibrated without attraction and instantaneously\n``quenched'', at constant colloid volume fraction, to one of two states beyond\nthe glass transition; one is close to the transition, and the other one deep in\nthe glass. The evolution of structural properties shows that bonds form in the\nsystem, increasing the local density, creating density deficits (holes)\nelsewhere. This process slows down with the time elapsed since the quench. As a\nconsequence of bond formation, there is a slowing down of the dynamics, as\nmeasured by the mean squared displacement and the density, bond, and\nenvironment correlation functions. The density correlations can be\ntime-rescaled to collapse their long time (structural) decay.

Using this method, all amplitudes for such decays can be expressed in\nterms of contractions, though the matrix elements are not evaluated. Many years\nago, Buras and Silvestrini proposed a similar approach. However, our technique\ngoes beyond theirs in several ways. First, we include recent theoretical and\nexperimental developments which indicate which contractions are negligible, and\nwhich are expected to be smaller than others. Second, we show that all B-decay\ndiagrams can be simply expressed in terms of contractions. This constitutes a\nformal proof that the diagrammatic method is rigourous. Third, we show that one\nreproduces the relations between tree and electroweak-penguin diagrams\ndescribed by Neubert and Rosner, and by Gronau, Pirjol and Yan. Fourth,\nalthough the previous results hold to all orders in alpha_s, we show that it is\nalso possible to work order-by-order in this approach. In this way it is\npossible to make a connection with the matrix-element evaluation methods of QCD\nfactorization (QCDfac) and perturbative QCD (pQCD). Finally, using the\ncontractions approach, we re-evaluate the question of whether there is a ``B ->\npi K puzzle.'' At O(alpha_s^0), we find that the diagram ratio |C'/T| is about\n0.17, a factor of 10 too small to explain all the B -> pi K data. Both QCDfac\nand pQCD find that, at O(\\alpha_s^1), the value of |C'/T'| may be raised to\nonly about 2-3 times its lowest-order value. We therefore conclude that,\nassuming the effect is not a statistical fluctuation, it is likely that the\nvalue of |C'/T'| is similar to its O(\\alpha_s^0) result, and that there really\nis a B -> pi K puzzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Mar 2006 22:25:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-08-27"}

Interpretive and predictive computational\ncapability in this area is assisted by the development of Vlasov codes, which\noffer high velocity space resolution in high energy regions of particle phase\nspace, and do not require analytical pre-processing of the fundamental\nequations. A direct Vlasov solver, capable of resolving these kinetic\nprocesses, is used here to address fundamental aspects of the existence and\nstability of the electron acoustic wave, together with its collective\nscattering properties. These simulations are extended to realistic laser and\nplasma parameters characteristic of single hot-spot experiments. Results are in\nqualitative agreement with experiments displaying both stimulated Raman and\nstimulated electron acoustic scattering. The amplitude of simulated EAWs is\ngreater than that observed experimentally, and is accompanied by a higher phase\nvelocity.
