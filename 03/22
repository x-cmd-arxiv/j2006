The flows presented here, which comprise a population of\ninitially identical clumps and the calculations are performed with and without\nthe inclusion of self-gravity. When the shock region is at its densest, we find\nthat the clump mass spectrum is always well modelled by a Salpeter type slope.\nThis is true regardless of whether the self-gravity is included in the\nsimulations or not. In the non-self-gravitating simulations, this slope is\nretained at lower Mach numbers (Mach 5 and 10) as the simulations progress past\nthe densest phase. In the simulations which include self-gravity, we find that\nlow Mach number runs yield a flatter mass function after the densest phase.\nThis is simply a result of increased coagulation due to gravitational collapse\nof the flows. In the high Mach number runs (Mach 20) the Salpeter slope is\nalways lost. The self gravitating calculations also show that the sub-group of\ngravitationally bound clumps in which star formation occurs, always contain the\nmost massive clumps in the population. The mass function of these bound star\nforming clumps is not at all similar to the Salpeter type mass function\nobserved for stars in the field. We conclude that the clump mass function may\nnot only have nothing to do with gravity, but also nothing to do with the star\nformation process and the resulting mass distribution of stars. This raises\ndoubt over the claims that the clump mass function is the origin of the stellar\nIMF, for regions such as rho Oph, Serpens and the Orion B cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2006 16:52:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Various theoretical models have been used\nto predict the relationship between emission line fluxes and metallicity,\nsuggesting that some line ratios can be used as diagnostics of the gas\nmetallicity in galaxies. However, accurate empirical calibrations of these\nemission line flux ratios from real galaxy spectra spanning a wide metallicity\nrange are still lacking. In this paper we provide such empirical calibrations\nby using the combination of two sets of spectroscopic data: one consisting of\nlow-metallicity galaxies with a measurement of [OIII]4363, and the other one\nconsisting of galaxies in the SDSS DR4 whose metallicity has been determined\nfrom various strong emission lines in their spectra. This combined data set\nconstitutes the largest sample of galaxies with information on the gas\nmetallicity available so far and spanning the widest metallicity range. Our\nempirical diagrams show that the line ratio [OIII]/[OII] is a useful tool to\nbreak the degeneracy in the R_23 parameter when no information on the [NII]\nline is available. The line ratio [NeIII]/[OII] also results to be a useful\nmetallicity indicator for high-z galaxies. Finally, we compare these empirical\nrelations with photoionization models. We find that the empirical\nR_23-metallicity sequence is strongly discrepant with respect to the trend\nexpected by models with constant ionization parameter, which is interpreted as\na consequence of a strong metallicity dependence of the average ionization\nparameter in galaxies.

This picture fits well with the observed young stellar discs\nnear the SgrA* black hole in the Galactic Center.

However, explaining the origin of\nthe several young stars closest to the black hole (the S-stars) is more\nproblematic: their orbits are compact, eccentric, and have random orientation.\nWe propose that the S-stars were born in a previous starburst(s), and then\nmigrated through their parent disc via type I or runaway migration.

The effect is quantified by the computation of the luminosity\nfunction (LF) of red galaxies. We found a flat slope, showing that the\nabundance of red galaxies is similar at faint and at intermediate magnitudes.\nComparison with present-day and z~0.4 LFs suggests that the slope of the LF is\nnot changed, within the errors, between z=0.831 and z=0. Therefore, the\nanalysis of the LF shows no evidence for a decreasing (with magnitude or\nredshift) number of faint red galaxies. The presence of faint red galaxies in\nhigh redshift clusters disfavours scenarios where the evolution of red galaxies\nis mass-dependent, because the mass dependency should differentially\ndepauperate the red sequence, while the MS1054-0321 colour-magnitude relation\nis populated as in nearby clusters and as in z~0.4 clusters. The presence of\nabundant faint red galaxies in the high redshift cluster MS1054-0321 restricts\nthe room for allocating descendants of Butcher-Oemler galaxies, because they\nshould change the faint end slope of the LF of red galaxies, while instead the\nsame faint end slopes are observed in MS1054-0321, at z~0 and at z~0.4. In the\nrich MS1054-0321 cluster, the colour-magnitude relation seems to be fully in\nplace at z=0.831 and therefore red galaxies of all magnitudes were wholly\nassembled at higher redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2006 14:24:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Essentially, users from multiple organizations\nare served from a single role base with roles designed to constrain their\naccess as needed.\n  Our work proposes, through parameterized roles and privileges, a means for\naccurately representing both users' roles within their respective hierarchies\nfor providing access to controlled objects. Using this method will reduce the\namount of complexity required in terms of the number of roles and privileges.\nThe resulting set of roles, privileges, and objects will make modeling and\nvisualizing the access role hierarchy significantly simplified. This paper will\ngive some background on role based access control, parameterized roles and\nprivileges, and then focus on how RBAC with parameterized roles and privileges\ncan be leveraged as an access control solution for the problems presented by\njoint tenancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2006 10:59:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2006 01:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The principal intracellular\nmediators of TGF-beta signalling are the Smad proteins, which upon TGF-beta\nstimulation accumulate in the nucleus and regulate transcription of target\ngenes. To investigate the mechanisms of Smad nuclear accumulation, we developed\na simple mathematical model of canonical Smad signalling. The model was built\nusing both published data and our experimentally determined cellular Smad\nconcentrations (isoforms 2, 3, and 4). We found in mink lung epithelial cells\nthat Smad2 (8.5-12 x 10^4 molecules/cell) was present in similar amounts to\nSmad4 (9.3-12 x 10^4 molecules/cell), while both were in excess of Smad3\n(1.1-2.0 x 10^4 molecules/cell). Variation of the model parameters and\nstatistical analysis showed that Smad nuclear accumulation is most sensitive to\nparameters affecting the rates of RSmad phosphorylation and dephosphorylation\nand Smad complex formation/dissociation in the nucleus. Deleting Smad4 from the\nmodel revealed that rate-limiting phospho-R-Smad dephosphorylation could be an\nimportant mechanism for Smad nuclear accumulation. Furthermore, we observed\nthat binding factors constitutively localised to the nucleus do not efficiently\nmediate Smad nuclear accumulation if dephosphorylation is rapid. We therefore\nconclude that an imbalance in the rates of R-Smad phosphorylation and\ndephosphorylation is likely an important mechanism of Smad nuclear accumulation\nduring TGF-beta signalling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Mar 2006 00:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Within a semiclassical description, we solve the equations for atomic\nmotion and internal dynamics to obtain analytic expressions for the optical\npotential and friction force seen by each atom. When optical gain is maximum at\nfrequencies where the light field extracts kinetic energy from the atomic\nmotion, the dynamics combines optical lasing and motional cooling. From the\ncorresponding momentum diffusion coefficient we predict sub-Doppler\ntemperatures in the stationary state. This generalizes the theory of cavity\nenhanced laser cooling to active cavity systems. We identify the gain induced\nreduction of the effective resonator linewidth as key origin for the faster\ncooling and lower temperatures, which implys that a bad cavity with a gain\nmedium can replace a high-Q cavity. In addition, this shows the importance of\nlight forces for gas lasers in the low-temperature limit, where atoms can\narrange in a periodic pattern maximizing gain and counteracting spatial hole\nburning. Ultimately, in the low temperature limit, such a setup should allow to\ncombine optical lasing and atom lasing in single device.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2006 19:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-18"}
