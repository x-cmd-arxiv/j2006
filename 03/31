Our method uses\nobserved superluminal motions and observed brightness temperatures for a large\nsample of AGN to constrain the characteristic intrinsic brightness temperature\nof the sample as a whole. To study changes in intrinsic brightness temperature,\nwe assume that the Doppler factors of individual jets are constant in time as\njustified by their relatively small changes in observed flux density. We find\nthat in their median-low brightness temperature state, the sources in our\nsample have a narrow range of intrinsic brightness temperatures centered on a\ncharacteristic temperature, T_int = 3 x 10^10 K, which is close to the value\nexpected for equipartition, when the energy in the radiating particles equals\nthe energy stored in the magnetic fields. However, in their maximum brightness\nstate, we find that sources in our sample have a characteristic intrinsic\nbrightness temperature greater than 2 x 10^11 K, which is well in excess of the\nequipartition temperature. In this state, we estimate the energy in radiating\nparticles exceeds the energy in the magnetic field by a factor of ~ 10^5. We\nsuggest that the excess of particle energy when sources are in their maximum\nbrightness state is due to injection or acceleration of particles at the base\nof the jet.

The distribution of\nphoton arrival times over binary orbital phase shows a deficit of X-ray\nemission around apastron, which suggests that the emission is caused by\ninteraction of the relativistic wind from J1537+1155A with its neutron star\ncompanion. We also reanalyzed the Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of\nJ0737-3039 and found that its X-ray spectrum is similar to the spectrum of\nB1534+12, and its X-ray luminosity is about the same fraction of Edot_A, which\nsuggests similar X-ray emission mechanisms. However, the X-ray emission from\nJ0737-3039 does not show orbital phase dependence. This difference can be\nexplained by the smaller eccentricity of J0737-3039 or a smaller misalignment\nbetween the equatorial plane of the millisecond pulsar and the orbital plane of\nthe binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2006 15:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The Josephson-like response involves a\nquasi-adiabatic evolution in the time-dependent field. Besides, we observe an\ninverse-Josephson (Shapiro) current by applying an AC bias; a supercurrent in\nthe absence of electromotive force can also be excited.

It is\nknown that a family of polyphase Golay sequences of length 2^m organizes in\nm!/2 cosets of a q-ary generalization of the first-order Reed-Muller code,\nRM_q(1,m). In this paper a more general construction technique for cosets of\nRM_q(1,m) with low PMEPR is established. These cosets contain so-called\nnear-complementary sequences. The application of this theory is then\nillustrated by providing some construction examples. First, it is shown that\nthe m!/2 cosets of RM_q(1,m) comprised of Golay sequences just arise as a\nspecial case. Second, further families of cosets of RM_q(1,m) with maximum\nPMEPR between 2 and 4 are presented, showing that some previously unexplained\nphenomena can now be understood within a unified framework. A lower bound on\nthe PMEPR of cosets of RM_q(1,m) is proved as well, and it is demonstrated that\nthe upper bound on the PMEPR is tight in many cases. Finally it is shown that\nall upper bounds on the PMEPR of cosets of RM_q(1,m) also hold for the\npeak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) under the Walsh-Hadamard transform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2006 08:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2006 09:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-16"}

There is no reason why the effective EoS of matter should be\nlinear at the highest energies, and a non-linear EoS may describe dark energy\nor unified dark matter (Paper I, astro-ph/0512224). In view of this, here we\nstudy the effects of a quadratic EoS in homogenous and inhomogeneous\ncosmological models in general relativity, in order to understand if in this\ncontext the quadratic EoS can isotropize the universe at early times.

The first part of the paper is devoted to the broad theme of\nisolating regions in the neutrino (and anti-neutrino) energy and propagation\nlength that are sensitive to the oscillation parameters. Such a study is\nrelevant to neutrinos both from the Earth's atmosphere or from a neutrino\nfactory. For completeness we discuss the sensitivity, however small, to the\nparameters involved in a three-generation framework, and to the Earth matter\ndensity profile. We then study processes relevant to atmospheric neutrinos\nwhich are sensitive to and allow precision measurements of the mixing angle\ntheta_23 and mass-squared difference delta_32 apart from the mixing angle\ntheta_13. Crucial to this analysis is charge identification; detectors having\nthis capability can isolate these matter effects. In particular, we address the\nissue of using matter effects to determine whether the mixing angle theta_23 is\nmaximal, and, if not, to explore how well its octant can be determined. When\nrealistic detector resolutions are included, we find that deviations of about\n15% (20%) from a maximal value of sin^2 theta_23=1/2 can be measured at 95%\n(99%) CL provided theta_13 is non-zero, sin^2 theta_13 >= 0.015, and the\nneutrino mass ordering is normal, with fairly large exposures of 1000\nkton-years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2006 11:09:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2006 09:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The interval smoothing problem updates all desired states within\na time interval using all available observations. The fixed-lag smoothing\nproblem updates only a fixed number of states prior to the observation at\ncurrent time. The fixed-lag smoothing problem is, in general, thought to be\ncomputationally faster than a fixed-interval smoother, and can be an\nappropriate approximation for long interval-smoothing problems. In this paper,\nwe use an ensemble-based approach to fixed-interval and fixed-lag smoothing,\nand synthesize two algorithms. The first algorithm produces a linear time\nsolution to the interval smoothing problem with a fixed factor, and the second\none produces a fixed-lag solution that is independent of the lag length.\nIdentical-twin experiments conducted with the Lorenz-95 model show that for lag\nlengths approximately equal to the error doubling time, or for long intervals\nthe proposed methods can provide significant computational savings. These\nresults suggest that ensemble methods yield both fixed-interval and fixed-lag\nsmoothing solutions that cost little additional effort over filtering and model\npropagation, in the sense that in practical ensemble application the additional\nincrement is a small fraction of either filtering or model propagation costs.\nWe also show that fixed-interval smoothing can perform as fast as fixed-lag\nsmoothing and may be advantageous when memory is not an issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Mar 2006 14:42:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Joliot-Curies' idea also relied\non the many Compton electron tracks in the Wilson chamber. In 1920, both\nHarkins and Rutherford foresaw the existence of a particle of mass 1 and zero\ncharge, consisting of one proton and one electron, though they did not give any\nname to it. In 1932, the neutron was finally observed by Chadwick. However, the\nquestion whether considering the neutron as a fundamental or a compound\nparticle still bothered the physicists and Chadwick himself for more than one\nyear. Instead, as soon as Majorana heard about Joliot-Curies' experiments he\nguessed the existence of a \"neutral proton.\" In 1933 he published some\n\"corrections\" to Heisenberg's theory. A very simple analysis shows that\nHeisenberg's original version of exchange interactions and Majorana's version\nclearly reflect, respectively, that the nucleus contained \"electrons\" and that\nthe nucleus was free from electrons. The emission of electrons from the nucleus\nstill needed to be accounted for. Fermi's theory of beta-decay settled the\nquestion. Thanks to exchange interactions and beta-decay theory, quantum\nmechanics could now be applied to the nucleus, which could be considered free\nfrom electrons.

We agree with\nthese authors up to this point, but, contrary to what is often believed, their\napproach failed to reconcile aether theory with the invariance of the apparent\n(measured) two-way speed of light. Yet, as we shall show, due to the systematic\nmeasurement distortions entailed by length contraction and clock retardation\nassumed by aether theory, the two-way speed of light, although anisotropic and\ndependent on the absolute speed of the frame where it is measured, is always\nfound equal to C.
