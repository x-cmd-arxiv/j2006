In the two-flavor\nsuperconducting (2SC) phase we calculate the effective potential for color\nvector potentials $A_\\alpha$ which are interpreted as the net momenta $q$ of\npairing in the Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrel (LOFF) phase. When\n$1/\\sqrt{2}<\\delta\\mu/\\Delta<1$ where $\\Delta$ is the gap energy, the effective\npotential suggests that the instability leads to a LOFF-like state which is\ncharacterized by color-rotated phase oscillations with small $q$. In the\nvicinity of $\\delta\\mu/\\Delta=1/\\sqrt{2}$ the magnitude of $q$ continuously\nincreases from zero as the effective potential has negative larger curvature at\nvanishing $A_\\alpha$ that is the Meissner mass squared. In the gapless 2SC\n(g2SC) phase, in contrast, the effective potential has a minimum at\n$gA_\\alpha\\sim\\delta\\mu\\sim\\Delta$ even when the negative Meissner mass squared\nis infinitesimally small. Our results imply that the chromomagnetic instability\nfound in the gapless phase drives the system toward the LOFF state with\n$q\\sim\\delta\\mu$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2006 09:01:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2006 08:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Currently, the\nstandard approach is to map a posteriori the results onto gene networks to\nelucidate the functions perturbed at the level of pathways. However,\nintegrating a priori knowledge of the gene networks could help in the\nstatistical analysis of gene expression data and in their biological\ninterpretation. Here we propose a method to integrate a priori the knowledge of\na gene network in the analysis of gene expression data. The approach is based\non the spectral decomposition of gene expression profiles with respect to the\neigenfunctions of the graph, resulting in an attenuation of the high-frequency\ncomponents of the expression profiles with respect to the topology of the\ngraph. We show how to derive unsupervised and supervised classification\nalgorithms of expression profiles, resulting in classifiers with biological\nrelevance. We applied the method to the analysis of a set of expression\nprofiles from irradiated and non-irradiated yeast strains. It performed at\nleast as well as the usual classification but provides much more biologically\nrelevant results and allows a direct biological interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Mar 2006 05:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
