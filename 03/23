Such a material appears to be\nstratified, displaying zones of different density, temperature, and ionization.\nIn this paper, we investigate the possibility of modelling the WA gas in NGC\n3783 as a single medium in total pressure equilibrium, in contrast to the\ncurrent descriptions that are based on the presence of multiple regions, each\nin constant density. The assumption of total pressure equilibrium yields a more\nphysical description of the WA, resulting in the natural stratification of the\nionized gas, and providing an explanation for the presence of lines from\ndifferent ionization states, as observed in WA spectra. We have used the\nphotoionization code TITAN to compute a grid of constant total pressure models\nwith the purpose of fitting the WA in NGC 3783. We have compared our models to\nthe 900 ks Chandra spectrum of NGC 3783 and to previous studies where the WA\nwas described by multiple zones of constant density. Our results show that the\nWA features in NGC 3783 can be well reproduced by a clumpy, ionized gas with\ncosmic abondances, ionization parameter = 2500 erg cm s^-1, column density = 4\n10^22 cm^-2, and constant total pressure. We have shown that the WA in NGC3783\ncan be modelled by a single medium in total pressure equilibrium; this is\nprobably the case for other WAs currently described by multi-zone, constant\ndensity models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2006 15:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

As interleaving and\nde-interleaving are performed within a block, the message-passing process\nassociated with an iterative decoder is limited to proceed within the\ncorresponding range. This paper presents a new turbo coding scheme that uses a\nspecial interleaver structure and a multiple-round early termination test\ninvolving both sign check and a CRC code. The new interleaver structure is\nnaturally suited for high speed parallel processing and the resulting coding\nsystem offers new design options and tradeoffs that are not available to CTCs.\nIn particular, it becomes possible for the decoder to employ an efficient\ninter-block collaborative decoding algorithm, passing the information obtained\nfrom termination test proved blocks to other unproved blocks.

A memory (storage) management mechanism is included as a\ncritical part of the decoder so as to provide additional design tradeoff\nbetween performance and memory size. It is shown that the latter has a\nmodular-like effect in that additional memory units render enhanced performance\ndue not only to less forced early terminations but to possible increases of the\ninterleaving depth.

It is demonstrated that the derived class\nof discretizations contains subclasses conserving classical norm or a modified\nnorm and classical momentum. These equations are interesting from the physical\nstandpoint since they support stationary discrete solitons free of the\nPeierls-Nabarro potential. As a consequence, even in highly-discrete regimes,\nsolitons are not trapped by the lattice and they can be accelerated by even\nweak external fields. Focusing on the cubic nonlinearity we then consider a\nsmall perturbation around stationary soliton solutions and, solving\ncorresponding eigenvalue problem, we (i) demonstrate that solitons are stable;\n(ii) show that they have two additional zero-frequency modes responsible for\ntheir effective translational invariance; (iii) derive semi-analytical\nsolutions for discrete solitons moving at slow speed. To highlight the unusual\nproperties of solitons in the new discrete models we compare them with that of\nthe classical DNLS equation giving several numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2006 02:44:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2006 05:17:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Because of this property, limited-diffraction beams may have\napplications in various areas such as medical imaging and tissue\ncharacterization. In this paper, fundamentals of limited-diffraction beams are\nreviewed and the studies of these beams are put into a unified theoretical\nframework.

Although the analytic\nexpressions for the energy eigenvalues $E_{n,l\\text{}}$ yield quite accurate\nresults for a wide range of $n,\\ell $ in the limit of very weak screening, the\nresults become gradually worse as the strength $b$ and the screening\ncoefficient $\\delta $ increase. This is because that the expansion parameter is\nnot sufficiently small enough to guarantee the convergence of the expansion\nseries for the energy levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2006 09:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Mod. Phys. 65, 803--815) gave lucid and strikingly\nsimple proofs of the Bell-Kochen-Specker (BKS) theorem in Hilbert spaces of\ndimensions four and eight by making use of what has since been referred to as\nthe Mermin(-Peres) \"magic square\" and the Mermin pentagram, respectively. The\nformer is a $3 \\times 3$ array of nine observables commuting pairwise in each\nrow and column and arranged so that their product properties contradict those\nof the assigned eigenvalues. The latter is a set of ten observables arranged in\nfive groups of four lying along five edges of the pentagram and characterized\nby similar contradiction. An interesting one-to-one correspondence between the\noperators of the Mermin-Peres square and the points of the projective line over\nthe product ring ${\\rm GF}(2) \\otimes \\rm{GF}(2)$ is established. Under this\nmapping, the concept \"mutually commuting\" translates into \"mutually distant\"\nand the distinguishing character of the third column's observables has its\ncounterpart in the distinguished properties of the coordinates of the\ncorresponding points, whose entries are both either zero-divisors, or units.\nThe ten operators of the Mermin pentagram answer to a specific subset of points\nof the line over GF(2)[$x$]/$<x^{3} - x>$. The situation here is, however, more\nintricate as there are two different configurations that seem to serve equally\nwell our purpose. The first one comprises the three distinguished points of the\n(sub)line over GF(2), their three \"Jacobson\" counterparts and the four points\nwhose both coordinates are zero-divisors; the other features the neighbourhood\nof the point ($1, 0$) (or, equivalently, that of ($0, 1$)). Some other ring\nlines that might be relevant for BKS proofs in higher dimensions are also\nmentioned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Mar 2006 10:01:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
