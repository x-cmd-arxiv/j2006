The faint R-band afterglow is seen to decline as\nt^(-0.66) while the X-ray falls as t^-1.18, indicating the presence of the\ncooling break between the two frequencies. However, the R-band afterglow is\nvery faint compared to the predicted extrapolation of the X-ray afterglow to\nthe optical regime (specifically, beta_OX ~ 0.2), while the K-band is\nconsistent with this extrapolation (beta_KX ~ 0.6), demonstrating suppression\nof the optical flux. Late time {\\it HST} observations place stringent limits on\nthe afterglow R-band flux implying a break in the R-band lightcurve. They also\nshow that the burst occurred at the edge of a faint red galaxy which most\nlikely lies at a significantly higher redshift than the previous optically\nidentified short-duration bursts. Several neighboring galaxies also have very\nred colors that are similarly suggestive of higher redshift. We consider\npossible explanations for the faintness and color of the burst. Our preferred\nmodel is that the burst occurred at moderately high redshift and was\nsignificantly obscured; however, it is also possible that the burst lies at z >\n4.5 in which case the faintness of the R-band afterglow could be attributed to\nthe Lyman-break. We discuss the implications that either scenario would have\nfor the nature of the progenitors of short bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2006 15:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The flow is necessarily turbulent,\nthat is, may be considered as a mean flow and a superimposed turbulence. In\nthis paper the induction processes of the turbulence are investigated within\nthe framework of mean--field electrodynamics. They imply of course a part which\nleads to an enhanced dissipation of the mean magnetic field. As a consequence\nof the helical mean flow there are also helical structures in the turbulence.\nThey lead to some kind of $\\alpha$--effect, which might basically support the\nscrew dynamo. The peculiarity of this $\\alpha$--effect explains measurements\nmade at a smaller version of the device envisaged for the dynamo experiment.\nThe helical structures of the turbulence lead also to other effects, which in\ncombination with a rotational shear are potentially capable of dynamo action. A\npart of them can basically support the screw dynamo. Under the conditions of\nthe experiment all induction effects of the turbulence prove to be rather weak\nin comparison to that of the main flow. Numerical solutions of the mean--field\ninduction equation show that all the induction effects of the turbulence\ntogether let the screw dynamo threshold slightly, at most by one per cent,\nrise. The numerical results give also some insights into the action of the\nindividual induction effects of the turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2006 16:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We used two cylindrical samples of different\noverall sizes, but each with its diameter nearly equal to its height. The fluid\nwas water with a Prandtl number of 4.38. The time series theta_0(t) consisted\nof meanderings similar to a diffusive process, but in addition contained large\nand irregular spontaneous reorientation events through angles Delta theta. We\nfound that reorientations can occur by two distinct mechanisms. One consists of\na rotation of the circulation plane without any major reduction of the\ncirculation strength. The other involves a cessation of the circulation,\nfollowed by a restart in a randomly chosen new direction. Rotations occurred an\norder of magnitude more frequently than cessations. Rotations occurred with a\nmonotonically decreasing probability distribution p(Delta theta), i.e. there\nwas no dominant value of Delta theta and small Delta theta were more common\nthan large ones. For cessations p(Delta theta) was uniform, suggesting that\ninformation of theta_0(t) before the cessation is lost. Both rotations and\ncessations have Poissonian statistics in time, and can occur at any theta_0.\nThe average azimuthal rotation rate increased as the circulation strength of\nthe LSC decreased. Tilting the sample relative to gravity significantly reduced\nthe frequency of occurrence of both rotations and cessations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2006 22:29:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
