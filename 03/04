The Lagrange\nconstraint is then imposed to guarantee that the functional dependence of the\nperturbed velocity on the time and constants stays the same as in the\nundisturbed case. Constants obeying this condition are called osculating\nelements. The constants chosen to be canonical are called Delaunay elements, in\nthe orbital case, or Andoyer elements, in the spin case. (As some Andoyer\nelements are time dependent even in the free-spin case, the role of constants\nis played by their initial values.) The Andoyer and Delaunay sets of elements\nshare a feature not readily apparent: in certain cases the standard equations\nrender them non-osculating. In orbital mechanics, elements furnished by the\nstandard planetary equations are non-osculating when perturbations depend on\nvelocities. To preserve osculation, the equations must be amended with extra\nterms that are not parts of the disturbing function. In the case of Delaunay\nparameterisation, these terms destroy canonicity. So under velocity-dependent\ndisturbances, osculation and canonicity are incompatible. (Efroimsky and\nGoldreich 2003, 2004) Similarly, the Andoyer elements turn out to be\nnon-osculating under angular-velocity-dependent perturbation. Amendment of only\nthe Hamiltonian makes the equations render nonosculating elements. To make them\nosculating, more terms must enter the equations (and the equations will no\nlonger be canonical).

This provides a many-body derivation of Berry curvatures in\nelectron dynamics with spin-orbit coupling, which has received much attention\nin recent years in non-interacting models. As is well-known, the Berry\ncurvature in momentum space modifies naive band dynamics via an artificial\nmagnetic field in momentum space. Our Fermi liquid formulation completes the\nreinvention of modified band dynamics by introducing in addition an \"artificial\nelectric field\", related to Berry curvature in frequency and momentum space. We\nshow explicitly how the artificial electric field affects the renormalization\nfactor and transverse conductivity of interacting U(1) Fermi liquids with\nnon-degenerate bands. Accordingly, we also propose a method of momentum\nresolved Berry's curvature detection in terms of angle resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2006 22:45:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jun 2007 15:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
