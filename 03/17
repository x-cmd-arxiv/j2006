The\ncosmic-ray resonant instability then takes over and is quenched by advection\nthrough the shock. The level of turbulence is determined by the non-resonant\nregime if the shock velocity $V_{\\rm sh}$ is larger than a few times $\\xi_{\\rm\nCR} c$, where $\\xi_{\\rm CR}$ is the ratio of the cosmic-ray pressure to the\nshock kinetic energy.

If N_f\\geq N and all quark masses are equal,\nit supports non-Abelian BPS strings which have internal (orientational) moduli.\nIf N_f>N these strings become semilocal, developing additional moduli \\rho\nrelated to (unlimited) variations of their transverse size.\n  Using the U(2) gauge group with N_f=3,4 as an example, we derive an effective\nlow-energy theory on the (two-dimensional) string world sheet.

We conclude that the Higgs branch of this\nmodel is not lifted by quantum effects. As a result, such strings cannot\nconfine.\n  Our analysis of infrared effects, not seen in the Hanany-Tong consideration,\nshows that, in fact, the derivative expansion can make sense only provided the\ntheory under consideration is regularized in the infrared, e.g. by the quark\nmass differences.

More specifically, the paper focuses on the\nestimation of model parameters for a class of generalized Gibbs random fields,\ni.e., Spartan Spatial Random Fields (SSRFs). The problem of parameter inference\nis based on the minimization of a distance metric. The latter involves a\nspecifically designed distance between sample constraints (variance,\ngeneralized ``gradient'' and ``curvature'') and their ensemble counterparts.\nThe general principles used in the construction of the metric are discussed and\nintuitively motivated. In order to enable calculation of the metric from sample\ndata, estimators for generalized ``gradient'' and ``curvature'' constraints are\nconstructed. These estimators, which are not restricted to SSRFs, are\nformulated using compactly supported kernel functions. An intuitive method for\nkernel bandwidth selection is proposed. It is proved that the estimators are\nasymptotically unbiased and consistent for differentiable random fields, under\nspecified regularity conditions. For continuous but non-differentiable random\nfields, it is shown that the estimators are asymptotically consistent. The bias\nis calculated explicitly for different kernel functions.

Contrary to the traditional\napproach with partonic degrees of freedom, we adopt a model built on hadronic\ndegrees of freedom to perform a study of the PW relation at intermediate\nenergies (100 MeV to 2 GeV). With upcoming high-statistics scattering\nexperiments such as MINER$\\nu$A and FINeSSE, a scrutiny of the PW relation is\ntimely. Employing a relativistic Glauber nucleon knockout model for the\ndescription of quasielastic neutrino-nucleus reactions, the influence of\nnuclear effects on the PW relation is investigated. We discuss nuclear-model\ndependences and show that the PW relation is a robust ratio, mitigating the\neffect of final-state interactions, for example to the 1% level. The role\nplayed by a possible strangeness content of the nucleon is investigated. It\nappears that the uncertainties arising from the poorly known strangeness\nparameters and the difficulties in nuclear modelling seriously limit the\napplicability of the PW relation as an intermediate-energy electroweak\nprecision tool. On the other hand, we show that nuclear effects may be\nsufficiently well under control to allow the extraction of new information on\nthe axial strangeness parameter.
