The path integral\nformalism is used to study this fermionic problem where the spin operators are\nrepresented by bilinear combinations of Grassmann fields.

The standard master equation method for Coulomb blockade\ncaptures the first effect, while a number of different approaches such as the\nnon-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) method are available for handling the\nlast two. But there is a need for a method that captures all three and in this\npaper we propose an approach that appears to fulfill this need. The equations\nlook similar to the NEGF formalism but one basic distinction is that all\nquantities (like the Hamiltonian) appearing in our formalism are defined in\nFock space and as such are matrices of dimension (2^N by 2^N), N being the\nnumber of basis functions describing the one-electron Hilbert space. Similar\nquantities appearing in the NEGF formalism are of dimension (N by N). Other\nimportant differences arise from the fact that in Fock space there is no need\nto include the exclusion principle explicitly and that elastic processes in\none-electron space look like inelastic processes in Fock space. A simple\nnumerical example is presented to show that our approach includes strong\nelectron-electron interaction, broadening due to coupling to contacts and\nquantum coherence effects due to spin polarization in directions other than the\nz-direction. The basic equations for this \"Fock space Green's function\" (FSGF)\nare quite general and should be applicable to more interesting and exotic\ntransport problems involving the entanglement of many-electron states.

We solve the coupled Boltzmann transport equations to determine in a\nconsistent way the current vs. voltage (IV) curve and the phonon occupation in\nmetallic SWNTs which are lying on a substrate. We find a good agreement with\nmeasured IV curves and we determine an optical phonon occupation which\ncorresponds to an effective temperature of several thousands K (hot phonons),\nfor the voltages typically used in experiments. We show that the high-bias\nresistivity strongly depends on the optical phonon thermalization time. This\nimplies that a drastic improvement of metallic nanotubes performances can be\nachieved by increasing the coupling of the optical phonons with a\nthermalization source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2006 11:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In the minimal model (``ghost condensation'')\nwith only a single extra degree of freedom at low energies, the scale of\nLorentz violation cannot be larger than about M ~ 100GeV due to an infrared\ninstability in the gravity sector. We show that Lorentz symmetry can be broken\nat much higher scales in a non-minimal theory with additional degrees of\nfreedom, in particular if Lorentz symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation\nvalue of a vector field. This theory can be constructed by gauging ghost\ncondensation, giving a systematic effective field theory description that\nallows us to estimate the size of all physical effects. We show that nonlinear\neffects become important for gravitational fields with strength \\sqrt{\\Phi} >\ng, where g is the gauge coupling, and we argue that the nonlinear dynamics is\nfree from singularities. We then analyze the phenomenology of the model,\nincluding nonlinear dynamics and velocity-dependent effects.

This accomplishes the program presented in\nform of conjectures in the previous paper quant-ph/0506034. Pivotal roles are\nplayed by the \"local observability principle\", which reconciles the holism of\nnonlocality with the reductionism of local observation, and by the postulated\nexistence of \"informationally complete observables\" and of a \"symmetric\nfaithful state\". This last notion allows one to introduce an operational\ndefinition for the real version of the \"adjoint\"--i. e. the transposition--from\nwhich one can derive a real Hilbert-space structure via either the\nMackey-Kakutani or the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal constructions. Here I analyze in\ndetail only the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction, which leads to a real\nHilbert space structure analogous to that of (classes of generally unbounded)\nselfadjoint operators in Quantum Mechanics. For finite dimensions, general\ndimensionality theorems that can be derived from a local observability\nprinciple, allow us to represent the elements of the real Hilbert space as\noperators over an underlying complex Hilbert space (see, however, a still open\nproblem at the end of the paper).
