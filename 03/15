The differences between the UV resonant lines and continuum\ndisk surface brightness distributions indicate a vertically extended disk with\nthe emission from these lines arising from the upper atmospheric layers.\nDistinct emission along the stream trajectory suggests the occurrence of gas\nstream overflow. Spatially resolved spectra show that the lines are in emission\nat all disk radii. The Balmer decrement becomes shallower with increasing\nradius. The FWHMs of the emission lines show differences with respect to that\nexpected for a gas in Keplerian rotation and the line intensities drop with a\nradial dependency of $I\\propto R^{-1.78}$. The uneclipsed light contributes\nabout 5 - 10 per cent of the total flux, and its spectrum is dominated by a\nBalmer jump and strong lines in emission. Broad absorption bands, possibly due\nto Fe II, are present in the spectra of the disk side farther away from the\nsecondary star, suggesting it arises from absorption by a extended gas region\nabove the disk; the differences between the spectra of the hemisphere farther\nfrom and nearer to the secondary star are interpreted in terms of chromospheric\nemission from a disc with a non-negligible opening angle (limb brightening\neffect).

The compressions generate turbulence that can accelerate\nmolecule production and produce the observed morphology. We then review the\nproperties of MC turbulence, including density enhancements observed as clumps\nand cores, magnetic field structure, driving scales, the relation to observed\nscaling relations, and the interaction with gas thermodynamics. We argue that\nMC cores are dynamical, not quasistatic, objects with relatively short\nlifetimes not exceeding a few megayears. We review their morphology, magnetic\nfields, density and velocity profiles, and virial budget. Next, we discuss how\nMC turbulence controls SF. On global scales turbulence prevents monolithic\ncollapse of the clouds; on small scales it promotes local collapse. We discuss\nits effects on the SF efficiency, and critically examine the possible relation\nbetween the clump mass distribution and the initial mass function, and then\nturn to the redistribution of angular momentum during collapse and how it\ndetermines the multiplicity of stellar systems. Finally, we discuss the\nimportance of dynamical interactions between protostars in dense clusters, and\nthe effect of the ionization and winds from those protostars on the surrounding\ncloud.

We assume that all investigated spectra are\ngenerated inside a spherical, homogeneous source and also analyse the\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton emission generated by such an object. The\nstochastic acceleration is treated as the diffusion of the particle momentum\nand is described by the momentum-diffusion equation. We investigate the\nstationary and time dependent solutions of the equation for several different\nevolutionary scenarios. The scenarios are divided into two general classes.\nFirst, we analyse a few cases without injection or escape of the particles\nduring the evolution. Then we investigate the scenarios where we assume\ncontinuous injection and simultaneous escape of the particles. In the case of\nno injection and escape the acceleration process, competing with the radiative\ncooling, only modifies the initial particle spectrum. The competition leads to\na thermal or quasi-thermal distribution of the particle energy. In the case of\nthe injection and simultaneous escape the resulting spectra depend mostly on\nthe energy distribution of the injected particles. In the simplest case, where\nthe particles are injected at the lowest possible energies, the competition\nbetween the acceleration and the escape forms a power-law energy distribution.\nWe apply our modeling to the high energy activity of the blazar Mrk 501\nobserved in April 1997.

The lack of both a significant amount of circumstellar material and\nany evidence of IR cooling from collimated jet/outflow driven by the source,\nindicates that, at least this member of the EXor class, is in a late stage of\nthe Pre-Main Sequence evolution. In the X-ray regime, an evident fading is\npresent, detected in the post-outburst phase, that cannot be reconciled with\nthe presence of any absorbing material. This circumstance, combined with the\npersistence (in the pre- and post-outburst phases) of a temperature component\nat about 10 MK, suggests that accretion has some influence in regulating the\ncoronal activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2006 10:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The relaxation rates can be\nconceived in terms of the so-called Pollicott-Ruelle resonances. In spatially\nextended systems, the transport coefficients can also be obtained from the\nPollicott-Ruelle resonances. The Liouvillian eigenstates associated with these\nresonances are in general singular and present fractal properties. The singular\ncharacter of the nonequilibrium states is shown to be at the origin of the\npositive entropy production of nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

We model protein sequences as realizations of Variable\nLength Markov Chains (VLMC) and we use the context trees as a signature of each\nprotein family.

The point of departure is a historical\nreview of four decades of string theory within the broader context of six\ndecades of failed attempts at an autonomous S-matrix approach to particle\ntheory. The central message, contained in sections 5 and 6, is that string\ntheory is not what its name suggests, namely a theory of of objects in\nspacetime whose localization is string- instead of point-like. Contrary to\npopular opinion the oscillators corresponding to the Fourier models of a\nquantum mechanical string do not cause a stringlike spatial extension of the\nobject under discussion and neither does the \"range space\" of a chiral\nconformal QFT acquire the interpretation of string-like localized quantum\nmatter. Rather the superstring represents a solution of a problem which enjoyed\nsome popularity in the 60s: the construction of infinite component wave\nfunction with a (realistic) mass/spin spectrum. The mass/spin tower \"sits\" over\none point and does not arise from a string in spacetime. The widespread\nacceptance of a theory whose interpretation has been based on metaphoric\nreasoning had a corroding influence on particle theory, a point which will be\nillustrated in the last section with some remarks of a more sociological\nnature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Mar 2006 19:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2006 15:46:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2006 15:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2006 19:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 26 Feb 2009 19:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The major challenge is that such breakthroughs are still only\nnotional concepts rather than being specific methods from which performance can\nbe rigorously quantified. A recent assessment by Tajmar and Bertolami used the\nrocket equation to correct naive misconceptions, but a more fundamental\nanalysis requires the use of energy as the basis for comparison. The energy of\na rocket is compared to an idealized space drive for the following cases:\nEarth-to-orbit, interstellar transit, and levitation. The space drive uses 3.6\ntimes less energy for Earth to orbit. For deep space travel, space drive energy\nscales as the square of delta-v, while rocket energy scales exponentially. This\nhas the effect of rendering a space drive 150-orders-of-magnitude better than a\n17,000-sec Specific Impulse rocket for sending a modest 5000 kg probe to\ntraverse 5 light-years in 50 years.

The first replaces selective\ninversions in the algorithm by selective phase shifts of $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$. The\nsecond controls the selective inversion operations using two ancilla qubits,\nand irreversible measurement operations on the ancilla qubits drive the\nstarting state towards the target state. Using $q$ oracle queries, these\nvariations reduce the probability of finding a non-target state from $\\epsilon$\nto $\\epsilon^{2q+1}$, which is asymptotically optimal.
