For different spectral models this yields\nan upper limit on the luminosity of 1.8x10^31 erg s^-1 (for an upper limit on\nthe distance of 10 kpc.)

The neutron star luminosity is\nso low that it is similar to the lowest luminosities derived for black hole\nSXTs in quiescence. This low luminosity for a neutron star SXT challanges the\nhypothesis presented in the literature that black hole SXTs in quiescence have\nlower luminosities than neutron star SXTs as a result of the presence of a\nblack hole event horizon. Furthermore, the limit on the neutron star luminosity\nobtained less than 20 years after the outburst has ceased, constrains the\nthermal conductivity of the neutron star crust. Finally, the neutron star core\nmust be so cold that unless the time averaged mass accretion rate is lower than\n2x10^-12 M_sun yr^-1, core cooling has to proceed via enhanced neutrino\nemission processes.

In this paper,\nwe investigate another hydromagnetic consequence of magnetic-helicity\naccumulation.

Taylor has remarked that U(1), being a\nmultiply-connected group, in general, should have different coupling strengths\nfor singlets and doublets. But in the development of the standard model, even\nfor U(1), the coupling strength has been taken to be the same for all the\nmultiplets without a priori justification.

We study KK mode wavefunctions of the full two-throat\nsystem in the Randall--Sundrum (RS) approximation and find an interesting\nsubtlety in the calculation of the KK mode tunnelling rate. While wavepacket\ntunnelling is suppressed unless the Standard Model throat is very long,\nwavefunctions of modes localized in different throats have a non-zero overlap\nand energy can be transferred between the throats by interactions between such\nKK modes. The corresponding decay rates are calculated and found to be faster\nthan the tunnelling rates found in previously published works. However, it\nturns out that the imaginary parts of the mode frequencies, induced by the\ndecay, slow the decay rates themselves down. The self-consistent decay rate\nturns out to be given by the plane wave tunnelling rate considered previously\nin the literature. We then discuss mechanisms that may enhance the energy\ntransfer between the throats over the RS rates. In particular, we study models\nin which the warp factor changes in the UV region less abruptly than in the RS\nmodel, and find that it is easy to build phenomenological models in which the\nplane wave tunnelling rate, and hence the KK mode interaction rates, are\nenhanced compared to the standard RS setup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2006 20:56:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2006 19:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2006 22:52:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-03"}

The very interesting result of this study is that the correction\nfrom the TE mode is dominated by low frequencies, for which the dielectric\ndescription of the metal is invalid. However, their analysis of the problem,\nbased on more appropriate low-frequency metallic boundary conditions, uses an\nincorrect form of boundary conditions for TE modes. We repeat their analysis,\nusing the correct boundary conditions. Our computations confirm their most\nimportant result: contrary to the result of the dielectric model, the thermal\nTE mode correction leads to an increase in the TE mode force of attraction\nbetween the plates. The magnitude of the correction has a value about twenty\ntimes larger than that quoted by them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Mar 2006 08:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
