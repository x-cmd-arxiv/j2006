Each of the n\nsets is represented by a simple closed curve. The n curves subdivide the plane\ninto 2^n open connected regions, each of which represents the intersection of\nits containing curves' sets. For example, two overlapping circles can divide\nthe plane into 4 regions representing {}, A, B, and A intersect B. Three\noverlapping circles can also be used to represent the 2^3 ways in which 3 sets\ncan intersect.\n  One of the primary questions related to Venn diagrams concerns which shapes\ncan be used for the curves. The previous examples used 2 and 3 circles, but a\n4-set Venn diagram cannot be represented by 4 circles; instead, ellipses must\nbe used.\n  In this paper, we consider Venn diagrams whose curves are the outlines of\npolyominoes. In particular, we give examples of Venn diagrams where the curves\nare rotations and translations of a single polyomino, so-called congruent\npolyVenn diagrams. We also consider the problem of area-minimization (relative\nto a scaling factor) and present examples of Venn polyominoes which minimize\narea according to various constraints.\n  At present, these examples do not generalize and so we develop an algorithm\nthat comes close to minimizing the area. The algorithm is simple and utilizes\nsymmetric chain decompositions of the Boolean lattice. We also provide\nasymptotic results that relate the area required by the algorithm's diagrams to\nthe theoretical minimum area. We conclude by presenting some open problems\nrelated to Venn polyominoes and other shape-constrained Venn diagrams.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Mar 2006 01:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

At present, special relativity is\ndivided into two parts, kinematics and dynamics. In kinematics, force and\nacceleration are not considered so that space and time becomes relative\nconcepts.

Preparing the ensemble of eigenstates of $\\rho$ with\nappropriate probabilities can be treated as `generous' strategy: it provides\nmaximal accessible information about the state. Another extremity is the\nso-called `Scrooge' ensemble, which is mostly stingy to share the information.\nWe introduce `lazy' ensembles which require minimal efforts to prepare the\ndensity matrix by selecting pure states with respect to completely random\nchoice.\n  We consider two parties, Alice and Bob, playing a kind of game. Bob wishes to\nguess which pure state is prepared by Alice. His null hypothesis, based on the\nlack of any information about Alice's intention, is that Alice prepares any\npure state with equal probability. Then, the average quantum state measured by\nBob turns out to be $\\rho$, and he has to make a new hypothesis about Alice's\nintention solely based on the information that the observed density matrix is\n$\\rho$. The arising `lazy' ensemble is shown to be the alternative hypothesis\nwhich minimizes the Type I error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2006 16:25:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-22"}
