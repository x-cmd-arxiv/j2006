We detected strong NaI D 5891,5897\ndoublet absorption in high-redshift DLAs at z=1.062 and 1.181, confirming the\npresence of NaI, which was first reported for the rest-frame UV NaI\n3303.3,3303.9 doublet by Petitjean et al. This is the first detection of NaI D\nabsorption in a high-redshift (z>1) DLA. In addition, we detected a new NaI\ncomponent in the z=1.062 DLA and four new components in the z=1.181 DLA. Using\nan empirical relationship between NaI and HI column density, we found that all\n\"components\" have large HI column density, so that each component is classified\nas DLA absorption. We also detected strong NaI D absorption associated with a\nMgII system at z=1.173. Because no other metal absorption lines were detected\nin this system at the velocity of the NaI absorption in previously reported\noptical spectra (observed 3.6 years ago), we interpret this NaI absorption\ncloud probably appeared in the line of sight toward the QSO after the optical\nobservation. This newly found cloud is likely to be a DLA based upon its large\nestimated HI column density. We found that the N(NaI)/N(CaII) ratios in these\nDLAs are systematically smaller than those observed in the Galaxy; they are\nmore consistent with the ratios seen in the Large Magellanic Cloud. This is\nconsistent with dust depletion generally being smaller in lower metallicity\nenvironments. However, all five clouds of the z=1.181 system have a high\nN(NaI)/N(CaII) ratio, which is characteristic of cold dense gas. We tentatively\nsuggest that the host galaxy of this system may be the most significant\ncontributor to the gravitational-lens toward APM 08279+5255.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Mar 2006 17:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Indirect evidence comes from high pulsar\nvelocities, associations of supernovae with long-soft gamma-ray bursts, and\nasymmetries in late-time emission-line profiles. Spectropolarimetry provides a\ndirect probe of young supernova geometry, with higher polarization generally\nindicating a greater departure from spherical symmetry. Large polarizations\nhave been measured for 'stripped-envelope' (that is, type Ic) supernovae, which\nconfirms their non-spherical morphology; but the explosions of massive stars\nwith intact hydrogen envelopes (type II-P supernovae) have shown only weak\npolarizations at the early times observed.
