The aim of our observations is to understand the processes\nforming the observed large abundances of methanol and formaldehyde in low-mass\nprotostellar envelopes (gas-phase processes ? chemistry on the grain surfaces\n?) and better constrain the chemical models. Methods : Using the IRAM 30m\nsingle-dish telescope, we observed deuterated formaldehyde (HDCO and D2CO) and\nmethanol (CH2DOH, CH3OD, and CHD2OH) towards a sample of seven low-mass class 0\nprotostars. Using population diagrams, we then derive the fractionation ratios\nof these species (abundance ratio between the deuterated molecule and its main\nisotopologue) and compare them to the predictions of grain chemistry models.\nResults : These protostars show a similar level of deuteration as in\nIRAS16293-2422, where doubly-deuterated methanol -- and even triply-deuterated\nmethanol -- were first detected. Our observations point to the formation of\nmethanol on the grain surfaces, while formaldehyde formation cannot be fully\npined down. While none of the scenarii can be excluded (gas-phase or grain\nchemistry formation), they both seem to require abstraction reactions to\nreproduce the observed fractionations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2006 16:16:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The deconvolved,\nthree-dimensional density of cluster members peaks at the Trapezium stars,\nwhich are truly anomalous in mass. Using theoretical pre-main-sequence tracks,\nwe confirm the earlier finding that star formation has accelerated over the\npast 10 Myr. We further show that the rate of acceleration has been the same\nfor all masses. Thus, there is no correlation between stellar age and mass,\ncontrary to previous claims. Finally, the acceleration has been spatially\nuniform throughout the cluster. Our reconstruction of the parent molecular\ncloud spawning the cluster shows that it had a mass of 6700 solar masses prior\nto its destruction by the Trapezium. If the cloud was supported against\nself-gravity by mildly dissipative turbulence, then it contracted in a\nquasi-static, but accelerating manner.

The mean turbulent speed\nincreased to its recent value, which is reflected in the present-day stellar\nvelocity dispersion. The current ONC will be gravitationally unbound once cloud\ndestruction is complete, and is destined to become a dispersing OB association.\nWe hypothesize that similarly crowded groups seen at the centers of distant OB\nassociations are also unbound, and do not give rise to the Galactic population\nof open clusters.

In addition to emission which we can clearly\nattribute to the surface of the reverse shock, we also measure comparable\nemission, in both H-alpha and Ly-alpha, which appears to emerge from supernova\ndebris interior to the surface. New observations taken through slits positioned\nslightly eastward and westward of a central slit show a departure from\ncylindrical symmetry in the H-alpha surface emission. Using a combination of\nold and new observations, we construct a light curve of the total H-alpha flux,\nF, from the reverse shock, which has increased by a factor ~ 4 over about 8\nyears. However, due to large systematic uncertainties, we are unable to discern\nbetween the two limiting behaviours of the flux - F ~ t (self-similar\nexpansion) and F ~ t^5 (halting of the reverse shock). Such a determination is\nrelevant to the question of whether the reverse shock emission will vanish in\nless than about 7 years (Smith et al. 2005). Future deep, low- or\nmoderate-resolution spectra are essential for accomplishing this task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2006 21:19:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We performed\nnumerical simulations using two Eulerian MHD codes, both based on finite\ndifference techniques: ZEUS--3D and NIRVANA. These were local shearing box\nsimulations incorporating vertical stratification. Both ideal and non ideal MHD\nsimulations with midplane dead zones were carried out. The codes were extended\nto incorporate different models for the dust as an additional fluid component.\nGood agreement between results obtained using the different approaches was\nobtained. The simulations show that a thin layer of very small dust particles\nis diffusively spread over the full vertical extent of the disk. We show that a\nsimple description obtained using the diffusion equation with a diffusion\ncoefficient simply expressed in terms of the velocity correlations accurately\nmatches the results. Dust settling starts to become apparent for particle sizes\nof the order of 1 to 10 centimeters for which the gas begins to decouple in a\nstandard solar nebula model at 5.2 AU.

In anticipation of a demand\nfor highly structured integrated practical waveguides, this paper addresses the\nimpact of this type of medium upon waveguides that can be also nonlinear. After\nan interesting historical overview and an exposure of some straightforward\nconcepts, a planar guide is investigated, in which the waveguide is a slab\nconsisting of a left-handed medium sandwiched between a substrate and cladding\nthat are simple dielectrics. The substrate and cladding display a Kerr-type\nnonlinear response. Because of the nonlinear properties of the Kerr media, the\npower flow direction can be controlled by the intensity of the electric field.\nA comprehensive finite-difference-time-domain (FDTD) analysis is presented that\nconcentrates upon spatial soliton behaviour. An interesting soliton-lens\narrangement is investigated that lends itself to a novel cancellation effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2006 11:51:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We demonstrate that source-channel (or source-network)\nseparation holds for several canonical network examples like the noisy multiple\naccess channel and the erasure degraded broadcast channel, when the whole\nnetwork operates over a common finite field. This robustness of separation is\npredicated on the fact that noise and inputs are independent, and we examine\nthe failure of separation when noise is dependent on inputs in multiple access\nchannels.\n  Our approach is based on the sufficiency of linear codes. Using a simple and\nunifying framework, we not only re-establish with economy the optimality of\nlinear codes for single-transmitter, single-receiver channels and for\nSlepian-Wolf source coding, but also establish the optimality of linear codes\nfor multiple access and for erasure degraded broadcast channels.

The\nlinearity of both source and network coding blurs the delineation between\nsource and network codes. While our results point to the fact that separation\nof source coding and channel coding is optimal in some canonical networks, we\nshow that decomposing networks into canonical subnetworks may not be effective.\nThus, we argue that it may be the lack of decomposability of a network into\ncanonical network modules, rather than the lack of separation between source\nand channel coding, that presents major challenges for coding over networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2006 16:52:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

Our\nmodel consists of a particle trapped in a cubic potential interacting with an\nenvironment characterized by dissipative and normal and anomalous diffusion\ncoefficients. A representation based on the energy eigenfunctions of the\nisolated system, i.e. the system uncoupled to the environment, is used to write\nthe reduced Wigner function, and the master equation becomes simpler in that\nrepresentation. The energy eigenfunctions computed in a WKB approximation\nincorporate the tunneling effect of the isolated system and the effect of the\nenvironment is described by an equation that it is in many ways similar to a\nFokker-Planck equation. Decoherence is easily identified from the master\nequation and we find that when the decoherence time is much shorter than the\ntunneling time the master equation can be approximated by a Kramers like\nequation describing thermal activation due to the zero point fluctuations of\nthe quantum environment. The effect of anomalous diffusion can be dealt with\nperturbatively and its overall effect is to inhibit tunneling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2006 18:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-04"}

The line is endowed with 18\npoints, spanning the neighbourhoods of three pairwise distant points. As\n$R\\_{\\clubsuit}$ is not a local ring, the neighbour (or parallel) relation is\nnot an equivalence relation so that the sets of neighbour points to two distant\npoints overlap. There are nine neighbour points to any point of the line,\nforming three disjoint families under the reduction modulo either of two\nmaximal ideals of the ring. Two of the families contain four points each and\nthey swap their roles when switching from one ideal to the other; the points of\nthe one family merge with (the image of) the point in question, while the\npoints of the other family go in pairs into the remaining two points of the\nassociated ordinary projective line of order two.
