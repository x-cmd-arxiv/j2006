We consider\nthe measured orbital periods, period derivatives and inferred X-ray\nluminosities of these two sources and find constraints on system parameters in\norder for the model to account for them. We find that these properties point to\nthe two sources being in different regimes of the UIM, with the requirement of\nlow magnetic moment primaries ($\\sim 10^{30} G cm^3$) for both. Given this weak\nmagnetization, RX J0806+15 has a sufficiently low luminosity that it can be\ninterpreted as having a primary spin almost synchronous to and just slightly\nslower than the orbital motion. Its measured orbital spin-up is only slightly\naffected by spin-orbit coupling and is mostly due to GW emission. RX J1914+24,\non the other hand, is too bright in X-rays and has too slow an orbital spin-up\nfor the same regime to apply. We suggest that this binary system may be\nemitting GWs at a significantly higher rate than implied by its measured\n$\\dot{\\omega}_o = 6 \\times 10^{-17} rad s^{-2}$. The latter is explained, in\nthis framework, by the primary spin being slightly faster than the orbital\nmotion ($\\alpha <or= 1.1$). In this case, the associated spin-orbit coupling\ntransfers to the orbit a significant amount of angular momentum, thus partially\nbalancing that lost to GW emission. All expectations can be tested in the near\nfuture to confirm the viability of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2006 16:32:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

In a non-supersymmetric case the inflaton\nusually decays via preheating unless its couplings to other fields are very\nsmall. Naively one would expect that supersymmetry enhances bosonic preheating\nas it introduces new scalars such as squarks and sleptons. On the contrary, we\npoint out that preheating is unlikely within supersymmetry. The reason is that\nflat directions in the scalar potential, classified by gauge invariant\ncombinations of slepton and squark fields, are generically displaced towards a\nlarge vacuum expectation value (VEV) in the early Universe. They induce\nsupersymmetry preserving masses to the inflaton decay products through the\nStandard Model Yukawa couplings, which kinematically blocks preheating for VEVs\n$> 10^{13}$ GeV. The decay will become allowed only after the flat directions\nstart oscillating, and once the flat direction VEV is sufficiently redshifted.\nFor models with weak scale supersymmetry, this generically happens at a Hubble\nexpansion rate: $H \\simeq (10^{-3}-10^{-1}) {\\rm TeV}$, at which time the\ninflaton decays in the perturbative regime.

Some intriguing cancellations in the\ncalculation of the non-abelian DBI Matrix actions result in the fuzzy-S^3 and\nS^5 having the same dynamics at large-N. For the Matrix model, we find analytic\nsolutions describing the time-dependent radius, in terms of Jacobi elliptic\nfunctions. Investigation of the physical properties of these configurations\nshows that there are no bounces for the trajectory of the collapse at large-N.\nWe also write down a set of useful identities for fuzzy-S^3, fuzzy-S^5 and\ngeneral fuzzy odd-spheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2006 11:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 May 2006 16:50:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In\nparticular, an alternative derivation of the effects described by special\nrelativity is provided, which is based on a description that assumes a\nprivileged reference frame. The present theory follows the ideas of Lorentz and\nPoincare, abandoning a strict view of Einstein's \"equivalence\" of all inertial\nframes. The meaning of the Principle of Relativity is discussed and elucidated,\nand it is shown that it is not incompatible with the existence of a preferred,\nabsolute, frame. Most scientists nowadays still consider the basic assumptions\nof the theory proposed here to be plain wrong. Moreover, they tend to see an\nirreconcilable conflict between the Lorentz-Poincare and the Einstein-Minkowski\nformulations. However, as stated by John Bell [Bell1988], although there is a\nstringent \"difference in philosophy\" between both views, \"the facts of physics\ndo not oblige us to accept one philosophy rather than the other\". The validity\nof Bell's assertion is unambiguously demonstrated, and it is shown how and why\nboth approaches do indeed agree in the description of (most of?) the physical\nphenomena. Evidently, the physical meaning of the different physical quantities\n- such as \"time\", \"speed\", \"simultaneity\" and \"synchronization\" - is quite\ndifferent in both programmes. And yet, for perplexing it may look at first\nsight, the present theory, developed under the Lorentz-Poincare assumption of a\npreferred reference frame, somehow encompasses Einstein's theory. There is no\nconflict, as there is one theory. It is stressed that reality is not changed by\nthe choices one makes to describe it, so it is not changed by the particular\nway in which the clocks have been set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2006 13:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
