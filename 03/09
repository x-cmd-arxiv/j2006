Using Spitzer data at 24, 70 and 160um in three deep fields, we\nstacked more than 19000 MIPS 24um sources with S24>60uJy at 70 and 160um, and\nmeasured the resulting FIR flux densities. Results. This method allows a gain\nup to one order of magnitude in depth in the FIR. We find that the Mid-Infrared\n(MIR) 24um selected sources contribute to more than 70% of the CIB at 70 and\n160um. This is the first direct measurement of the contribution of MIR-selected\ngalaxies to the FIR CIB.

We present\nan analytic theory with P2 and P1 treated as test particles. This analytic\ntheory shows that the azimuthal periods of P2 and P1 are shorter than the\nKeplerian orbital periods and that the periapse and ascending node of each of\nthe satellites precess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions. The\ndeviation from Kepler's third law is already detected in the unperturbed\nKeplerian fit of Buie and coworkers. We also present direct numerical orbit\nintegrations with different assumed masses for P2 and P1 within the ranges\nallowed by the albedo uncertainties.

Many young\nplanetary nebulae display distinct bipolar structures as they evolve away from\nthe proto-planetary nebulae phase. One possible cause of their bipolarity could\nbe due to a binary origin of its energy source. Here we report our detailed\ninvestigation of the young planetary nebula, Hubble 12, which is well-known for\nits extended hourglass-like envelope. We present evidence with time-series\nphotometric observations the existence of an eclipsing binary at the center of\nHubble 12. Low-resolution spectra of the central source show, on the other\nhand, absorption features such as CN, G-band & Mg b${\\arcsec}$, which can be\nsuggestive of a low-mass nature of the secondary component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2006 06:52:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This effect is usually\nassociated with an increased probability of formation of a percolating cluster\nof filler particles in the matrix. Previous model calculations of percolation\nin polymeric systems generally did not take the possible difference between the\nsize and shape of monomers and filler particles into account and usually\nneglected interactions or accounted for them in a crude fashion. In our\napproach the original lattice is replaced by a recursive structure on which\ncalculations are done exactly and interactions as well as size and shape\ndisparities can be easily taken into account. Here we introduce the recursive\napproach, we describe how to derive the percolation threshold as a function of\nthe various parameters of the problem and we apply the new approach to the\nanalysis of the effect of correlations among monodisperse particles on the\npercolation threshold of a system. Then in the second paper of the series we\ntackle the issue of the effect of size and shape disparities of the particles\non their percolation properties while in the last part we describe the effect\nof the presence of a polymer matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2006 16:23:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2006 10:00:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2006 14:02:47 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2006 16:32:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2006 14:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For a particular user, the receiver selects a signature vector from a\nsignature codebook to avoid the interference from other users, and feeds the\ncorresponding index back to this user through a finite rate and error-free\nfeedback link. We assume the codebook is randomly constructed where the entries\nare independent and isotropically distributed. It has been shown that the\nrandomly constructed codebook is asymptotically optimal. In this paper, we\nconsider two types of signature selection criteria. One is to select the\nsignature vector that minimizes the interference from other users. The other\none is to select the signature vector to match the weakest interference\ndirections. By letting the processing gain, number of users and feedback bits\napproach infinity with fixed ratios, we derive the exact asymptotic formulas to\ncalculate the average interference for both criteria. Our simulations\ndemonstrate the theoretical formulas. The analysis can be extended to evaluate\nthe signal-to-interference plus noise ratio performance for both match filter\nand linear minimum mean-square error receivers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2006 03:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

In pre-Maxwell electrodynamics -- the local gauge theory associated\nwith this framework -- events induce five local off-shell fields, which mediate\ninteractions between instantaneous events, not between the worldlines which\nrepresent entire particle histories. The fifth field, required to compensate\nfor dependence of gauge transformations on the evolution parameter, enables the\nexchange of mass between particles and fields.

Rev.\nA {\\bf 68}, 032308 (2003)] provides a natural and reliable indicator of quantum\nchaotic behavior. Since generalized entanglement depends directly on a choice\nof preferred observables, exploring how generalized entanglement increases\nunder dynamical evolution is possible without invoking an auxiliary coupled\nsystem or decomposing the system into arbitrary subsystems. We find that, in\nthe chaotic regime, the long-time saturation value of generalized entanglement\nagrees with random matrix theory predictions. For our system, we provide\nphysical intuition into generalized entanglement within a single system by\ninvoking the notion of extent of a state. The latter, in turn, is related to\nother signatures of quantum chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Mar 2006 20:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2006 14:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The\nsecond extension is a function-dependent generalization of the simplest\nquadratic commutation relation with only a nonzero minimal uncertainty in\nposition.
