Similar features have been discovered in the AGB populations\nof other clusters. Unfortunately all of these studies suffer from low AGB star\ncounts so the conclusions are not necessarily robust -- larger, statistically\nsignifcant, sample sizes are needed.\n  We outline the results of a literature search for relevant CN observations\nand describe our observing proposal to test the suggestion that there are\nsubstantial abundance differences between the AGB and RGB in galactic globular\nclusters. The literature search revealed that the AGB star counts for all\nstudies (which are not, in general, studies about AGB stars in particular) are\nlow, usually being < or = 10. The search also revealed that the picture may not\nbe consistent between clusters. Although most clusters appear to have CN-weak\nAGBs, at least two seem to have CN-strong AGBs (M5 & 47 Tuc). To further\ncomplicate the picture, clusters often appear to have a combination of both\nCN-strong and CN-weak stars on their AGBs -- although one population tends to\ndominate. Again, all these assertions are however based on small sample\nsizes.We aim to increase the sample sizes by an order of magnitude using\nexisting high quality photometry in which the AGB and RGB can be reliably\nseparated. For the observations we will use a wide-field, low- to\nmid-resolution multi-object spectroscope. With the new information we hope to\nascertain whether significant abundance differences really exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2006 02:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Using different existing catalogues, over\n85% of the X-ray sources could be associated with at least one optical and/or\ninfrared counterpart within a limited cross-correlation radius of 3 arcsec at\nmaximum. The surface density distribution of the X-ray sources presents a\nslight N-S elongation. Once corrected for the spatial sensitivity variation of\nthe EPIC instruments, the radial profile of the source surface density is well\ndescribed by a King profile with a central density of about 8 sources per\narcmin^2 and a core radius close to 3.1arcmin. The distribution of the X-ray\nsources seems closely related to the optical source distribution. The expected\nnumber of foreground and background sources should represent about 9% of the\ndetected sources, thus strongly suggesting that most of the observed X-ray\nemitters are physically belonging to NGC 6231. Finally, beside a few bright but\nsoft objects -- corresponding to the early-type stars of the cluster -- most of\nthe sources are relatively faint (~5E-15 erg/s/cm^2) with an energy\ndistribution peaked around 1.0-2.0 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2006 09:21:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

To\nthis effect we first analyze the net hamiltonian, H(N), of N conduction\nelectrons to identify its universal part, H_o(N) (independent of the nature of\na specific solid or a specific class of solids), and then study the states of\nH_o(N) to conclude that superconductivity originates, basically, from an\ninter-play between the zero- point force (f_o) of conduction electrons in their\nground state and the inter-atomic forces (f_a) which decide the lattice\nstructure. This renders a kind of mechanical strain in the lattice which serves\nas the main source of phonon induced inter-electron attraction responsible for\nthe formation of Cooper type pairs and the onset of superconductivity below\ncertain temperature T_c. We determine the binding energy of such pairs and find\na relation for T_c which not only accounts for the highest experimental T_c =\n135 K that we know to-day but also indicates that superconductivity may, in\nprinciple, occur at room temperature. It is evident that electrical strain in\nthe lattice (i.e., electrical polarization of the lattice constituents produced\nby the charge of conducting electrons) can have an added contribution to the\nphonon induced attraction of two electrons. Our theoretical framework not only\nincorporates BCS model but also provides microscopic basis for the two well\nknown phenomenologies of superconductivity, viz., the two fluid theory and\nPsi-theory.

A\ntheoretical derivation of the generated fields using Maxwell's equations is\npresented followed by a theoretical analysis of the phase and group speed of\nthe propagating fields. This theoretical prediction is then verified by a\nnumerical simulation which demonstrates the superluminal propagation of\nmodulated signals in the nearfield of their sources. An experiment using simple\ndipole antennas is also presented which verifies the theoretically expected\nsuperluminal propagation of transverse electromagnetic fields in the nearfield\nof the source. The phase speed, group speed, and information speed of these\nsystems are compared and shown to differ. Provided the noise of a signal is\nsmall and the modulation method is known, it is shown that the information\nspeed can be approximately the same as the superluminal group speed. According\nto relativity theory, it is known that between moving reference frames,\nsuperluminal signals can propagate backwards in time enabling violations of\ncausality. Several explanations are presented which may resolve this dilemma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2006 16:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Fixing a finite group G, this is the\nproblem of recovering an involution m = (m_1, ..., m_n) in G^n from an oracle f\nwith the property that f(x) = f(xy) iff y equals m or the identity. In the\ncurrent parlance, this is the hidden subgroup problem (HSP) over groups of the\nform G^n, where G is a nonabelian group of constant size, and where the hidden\nsubgroup is either trivial or has order two.

We describe the currently known\nsecurity features of AlphaEta and similar systems, including lower bounds on\nthe unicity distances against ciphertext-only and known-plaintext attacks. We\nshow how AlphaEta used in conjunction with any standard stream cipher such as\nAES (Advanced Encryption Standard) provides an additional, qualitatively\ndifferent layer of security from physical encryption against known-plaintext\nattacks on the key. We refute some claims in the literature that AlphaEta is\nequivalent to a non-random stream cipher.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Mar 2006 00:01:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2006 01:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 May 2006 21:13:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 May 2006 23:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2006 21:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
