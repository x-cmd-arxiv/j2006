The tuning is such\nthat the theory is near an Argyres-Douglas-type singularity where a set of\nnon-local dibaryons becomes massless in conjunction with a set of confining\nstrings becoming tensionless. The doubly-scaled theory consists of two\ndecoupled sectors, one whose spectrum and interactions follow the usual large-N\nscaling whilst the other has light states of fixed mass in the large-N limit\nwhich subvert the usual large-N scaling and lead to an interacting theory in\nthe limit. $F$-term properties of this interacting sector can be calculated\nusing a Dijkgraaf-Vafa matrix model and in this context the double-scaling\nlimit is precisely the kind investigated in the \"old matrix model'' to describe\ntwo-dimensional gravity coupled to $c<1$ conformal field theories. In\nparticular, the old matrix model double-scaling limit describes a sector of a\ngauge theory with a mass gap and light meson-like composite states, the\napproximate Goldstone boson of superconformal invariance, with a mass which is\nfixed in the double-scaling limit.

We show that\nfew-cycle pulses directly produce a spatial charge asymmetry in the plasma.
