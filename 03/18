Since the submm emission presents an unusually large angular\nextent (~1 arcmin), the possible radio emission asociatted with that system can\nhelp to identify optical/NIR counterparts due to the higher spatial resolution\nand astrometric accuracy of the radio observations.

In particular we discuss them in the context of the current\ndebate surrounding the formation and evolution of cores. There exist several\nfamilies of model scenarios to explain this evolution (with many variations of\neach) that can be thought of as a continuum of models lying between two extreme\nparadigms for the star and core formation process. At one extreme there is the\ndynamic, turbulent picture, while at the other extreme there is a slow,\nquasi-static vision of core evolution. In the latter view the magnetic field\nplays a dominant role, and it may also play some role in the former picture.\nPolarization and Zeeman measurements indicate that some, if not all, cores\ncontain a significant magnetic field. Wide-field surveys constrain the\ntimescales of the core formation and evolution processes, as well as the\nstatistical distribution of core masses. The former indicates that prestellar\ncores typically live for 2--5 free-fall times, while the latter seems to\ndetermine the stellar initial mass function. In addition, multiple surveys\nallow one to compare core properties in different regions. From this it appears\nthat aspects of different models may be relevant to different star-forming\nregions, depending on the environment. Prestellar cores in cluster-forming\nregions are smaller in radius and have higher column densities, by up to an\norder of magnitude, than isolated prestellar cores. This is probably due to the\nfact that in cluster-forming regions the prestellar cores are formed by\nfragmentation of larger, more turbulent cluster-forming cores, which in turn\nform as a result of strong external compression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2006 16:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

They provide\npartial pressure support against gravity, they trace past energetic events such\nas supernovae, and they reveal the underlying structure of the baryonic matter\ndistribution through their interactions. To study the impact of CRs on galaxy\nand cosmic structure formation and evolution, we develop an approximative\nframework for treating dynamical and radiative effects of CRs in cosmological\nsimulations. Our guiding principle is to try to find a balance between\ncapturing as many physical properties of CR populations as possible while at\nthe same time requiring as little extra computational resources as possible. We\napproximate the CR spectrum of each fluid element by a single power-law, with\nspatially and temporally varying normalisation, low-energy cut-off, and\nspectral index. Principles of conservation of particle number, energy, and\npressure are then used to derive evolution equations for the basic variables\ndescribing the CR spectrum, both due to adiabatic and non-adiabatic processes.\nThe processes considered include compression and rarefaction, CR injection via\nshocks in supernova remnants, injection in structure formation shock waves,\nin-situ re-acceleration of CRs, CR spatial diffusion, CR energy losses due to\nCoulomb interactions, ionisation losses, Bremsstrahlung losses, and, finally,\nhadronic interactions with the background gas, including the associated\ngamma-ray and radio emission due to subsequent pion decay. We show that the\nformalism reproduces CR energy densities, pressure, and cooling rates with an\naccuracy of ~10% in steady state conditions where CR injection balances\ncooling.

This phase is surprising for more than\none reason. First, such a hot plasma should not be bound to the Galactic plane\nand the power needed to sustain the escaping matter would be higher then any\nknown source. Second, there is no known mechanism able to heat the plasma to\nmore than a few keV. Recently we have suggested that, hydrogen having escaped,\nthe hot plasma could be a helium plasma, heavy enough to be gravitationally\nconfined. In this case, the required power is much more reasonable. We present\nhere a possible heating mechanism which taps the gravitational energy of the\nmolecular clouds. We note that the 8 keV plasma is highly viscous and we show\nhow viscous friction of molecular clouds flowing within the hot phase can\ndissipate energy in the gas and heat it. We detail the MHD wake of a spherical\ncloud by considering the different MHD waves the cloud can excite. We find that\nmost of the energy is dissipated by the damping of Alfvenic perturbations in\ntwo possible manners, namely by non-linear effects and by a large scale\ncurvature of the field lines. Depending on the field strength, this heating can\nbalance the radiative cooling. We note that the plasma parameters may be\noptimal to make the dissipation most efficient, suggesting a self-regulation\nmechanism. The loss of kinetic and gravitational energy also causes accretion\nof the clouds and may have significant action on the gas dynamics in this\nregion between the large scale, bar dominated flow and the central accretion to\nthe massive black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2006 00:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A\ncomparison of the colour and period relations with those of similar stars in\nthe Large Magellanic Cloud indicates minor differences, which may be the\nconsequence of sample selection effects. Apparent bolometric magnitudes were\ndetermined by combining the mean JHKL fluxes with mid-infrared photometry from\nIRAS and MSX. Then, using the Mira period luminosity relation to set the\nabsolute magnitudes, distances were determined -- to greater accuracy than has\nhitherto been possible for this type of star. Bolometric corrections to the K\nmagnitude were calculated and prescriptions derived for calculating these from\nvarious colours. Mass-loss rates were also calculated and compared to values in\nthe literature.\n  Approximately one third of the C-rich Miras and an unknown fraction of the\nnon-Miras exhibit apparently random obscuration events that are reminiscent of\nthe phenomena exhibited by the hydrogen deficient RCB stars. The underlying\ncause of this is unclear, but it may be that mass loss, and consequently dust\nformation, is very easily triggered from these very extended atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Mar 2006 13:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Here we explore general boundary conditions\ncoupling the widely separated ``teeth'' of the microscopic simulation that\nachieve high order accuracy over the macroscale. We present the simplest case\nwhen the microscopic simulator is the quintessential example of a partial\ndifferential equation.

This paper uses rf pulse to implement\nHadamard operation (rotation) and stimulated Raman transition technique as\nunitary shift operator. The scheme suggests implementation of Hadamard\noperation and unitary shift operator while the BEC is trapped in long Rayleigh\nrange optical dipole trap. The Hadamard rotation and a unitary shift operator\non BEC prepared in one of the internal state followed by a bit flip operation,\nimplements one step of the Hadamard walk. To realize a sizable number of steps,\nthe process is iterated without resorting to intermediate measurement. With\ncurrent dipole trap technology it should be possible to implement enough steps\nto experimentally highlight the discrete quantum random walk using a BEC\nleading to further exploration of quantum random walks and its applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2006 17:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2006 12:04:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2006 05:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2006 04:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

DPT\nis a beyond-mean-field method which is applicable to both weakly and\nstrongly-interacting systems and can be used to connect both limits. In a\nprevious paper we developed the formalism for low-order energies and excitation\nfrequencies. This formalism has been applied to atoms, Bose-Einstein\ncondensates and quantum dots. One major advantage of the method is that N\nappears as a parameter in the analytical expressions for the energy and so\nresults for N up to a few thousand are easy to obtain. Other properties\nhowever, are also of interest, for example the density profile in the case of a\nBEC,and larger N results are desirable as well. The latter case requires us to\ngo to higher orders in DPT. These calculations require as input zeroth-order\nwave functions and this paper, along with a subsequent paper, addresses this\nissue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Mar 2006 20:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
