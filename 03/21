The recent measurement by the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe (WMAP) of the optical depth to electron scattering,\ntau=0.09+/-0.03, provides the first empirical evidence for this suppression.\nThe new WMAP result is consistent with vanilla models of reionization, in which\nionizing sources populate cold dark matter (CDM) halos down to a virial\ntemperature of T_vir=10^4K.

We use these data to constrain the halo occupation\ndistribution (HOD), then calculate the PVD by populating the halos of a high\nresolution N-body simulation. We examine the luminosity and scale dependence of\nthe predicted PVD. At r<1 Mpc/h and r>3 Mpc/h, we find that the PVD decreases\nwith increasing galaxy luminosity. This result is mostly driven by the fraction\nof satellite galaxies f_sat, which is well-constrained by the correlation\nfunction. We find f_sat~25% for galaxies fainter than L_star, while for\nbrighter galaxies the satellite fraction rapidly declines, creating the\ndecrease in the PVD with luminosity. At r=1 Mpc/h, the PVD has no dependence on\nluminosity because satellite galaxies dominate the statistics for all objects.\nRecent measurements of the PVD in Fourier space using the \"dispersion model\"\nhave reported a strong decline in PVD with increasing luminosity at k=1 h/Mpc.\nWe test this method with our HOD models, finding that there is no consistent\ncomparison between the PVD at a given k and the true dispersion at a given\nvalue of r. This results in a luminosity dependence in k-space that is stronger\nthan in configuration space. The luminosity dependence of the HOD results in\nFourier space are consistent with those measured at k=1 h/Mpc; thus the recent\nmeasurements of the PVD are fully explainable in the context of halo occupation\nmodels. The normalization of the PVD is lower than predicted by our fiducial\nmodel, and reproducing it requires a lower value of Omega_m (~0.2 instead of\n0.3), a lower value of sigma_8 (~0.7 instead of 0.9), or strong velocity bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2006 21:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We revisit the capability of the\nWR winds to eject these radionuclides using new models of single non-exploding\nWR stars with metallicity Z = 0.02. The earlier predictions for non-rotating WR\nstars are updated, and models for rotating such stars are used for the first\ntime in this context. We find that (1) rotation has no significant influence on\nthe short-lived radionuclide production by neutron capture during the core\nHe-burning phase, and (2) 26Al, 36Cl, 41Ca, and 107Pd can be wind-ejected by a\nvariety of WR stars at relative levels that are compatible with the meteoritic\nanalyses for a period of free decay of around 10^5 y between production and\nincorporation into the forming solar system solid bodies. We confirm the\npreviously published conclusions that the winds of WR stars have a radionuclide\ncomposition that can meet the necessary condition for them to be a possible\ncontaminating agent of the forming solar system. Still, it remains to be\ndemonstrated from detailed models that this is a sufficient condition for these\nwinds to have provided a level of pollution that is compatible with the\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2006 15:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We show that the process of\ninterface detachment, which immediately precedes the inception of frictional\nsliding, is governed by three different types of detachment fronts. These\ncrack-like detachment fronts differ by both their propagation velocities and by\nthe amount of net contact surface reduction caused by their passage. The most\nrapid fronts propagate at intersonic velocities but generate a negligible\nreduction in contact area across the interface. Sub-Rayleigh fronts are\ncrack-like modes which propagate at velocities up to the Rayleigh wave speed,\nVR, and give rise to an approximate 10% reduction in net contact area. The most\nefficient contact area reduction (~20%) is precipitated by the passage of slow\ndetachment fronts. These fronts propagate at anomalously slow velocities, which\nare over an order of magnitude lower than VR yet orders of magnitude higher\nthan other characteristic velocity scales such as either slip or loading\nvelocities. Slow fronts are generated, in conjunction with intersonic fronts,\nby the sudden arrest of sub-Rayleigh fronts. No overall sliding of the\ninterface occurs until either of the slower two fronts traverses the entire\ninterface, and motion at the leading edge of the interface is initiated. Slip\nat the trailing edge of the interface accompanies the motion of both the slow\nand sub-Rayleigh fronts.

A stress\ntensor and a spin current can be defined just by requiring the existence of a\nwell defined volume element instead of an induced metric, so as to allow for\ngeneric torsion sources. In general, when the torsion is localized on the\ndomain wall, it is necessary to relax the continuity of the tangential\ncomponents of the vielbein. In fact it is found that the spin current is\nproportional to the jump in the vielbein and the stress-energy tensor is\nproportional to the jump in the spin connection. The consistency of the\njunction conditions implies a constraint between the direction of flow of\nenergy and the orientation of the spin. As an application, we derive the\ncircularly symmetric solutions for both the rotating string with tension and\nthe spinning dust string in three dimensions. The rotating string with tension\ngenerates a rotating truncated cone outside and a flat space-time with\ninevitable frame dragging inside. In the case of a string made of spinning\ndust, in opposition to the previous case no frame dragging is present inside,\nso that in this sense, the dragging effect can be \"shielded\" by considering\nspinning instead of rotating sources.

Starting in the 80s I will discuss the spectral flow\nand the general linear conjugation problem, the Calderon projector and the\ntopology of space of elliptic boundary problems. The theme of the 90s is the\neta invariant. The paper with Douglas was fundamental for establishing spectral\ninvariants for manifolds with boundary and for the investigation of the\nbehavior of spectral invariants under analytic surgery. This was so influential\nthat many different proofs of the gluing formula for the eta-invariant were\npublished. Finally turning to the new millennium we will look at the\nzeta--determinant. Compared to eta this is a much more rigid spectral invariant\nwhich is technically challenging.\n  This paper was presented at the workshop \"Krzysztof Wojciechowski - 50 Years\"\nheld in May 2005 near Roskilde/Denmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2006 11:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Within the orthodox interpretation of QM the\npropositions of QL cannot be associated with sentences of a language stating\nproperties of individual samples of a physical system, since properties are\nnonobjective in QM. This makes the interpretation of propositions\nproblematical. The difficulty can be removed by adopting the objective\ninterpretation of QM proposed by one of the authors (semantic realism, or SR,\ninterpretation). In this case, a unified perspective can be adopted for QM and\nclassical mechanics (CM), and a simple first order predicate calculus L(x) with\nTarskian semantics can be constructed such that one can associate a physical\nproposition (i.e., a set of physical states) with every sentence of L(x). The\nset $P^{f}$ of all physical propositions is partially ordered and contains a\nsubset $P^{f}_{T}$ of testable physical propositions whose order structure\ndepends on the criteria of testability established by the physical theory. In\nparticular, $P^{f}_{T}$ turns out to be a Boolean lattice in CM, while it can\nbe identified with QL in QM. Hence the propositions of QL can be associated\nwith sentences of L(x), or also with the sentences of a suitable quantum\nlanguage $L_{TQ}(x)$, and the structure of QL characterizes the notion of\ntestability in QM. One can then show that the notion of quantum truth does not\nconflict with the classical notion of truth within this perspective.\nFurthermore, the interpretation of QL propounded here proves to be equivalent\nto a previous pragmatic interpretation worked out by one of the authors, and\ncan be embodied within a more general perspective which considers states as\nfirst order predicates of a broader language with a Kripkean semantics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2006 16:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
