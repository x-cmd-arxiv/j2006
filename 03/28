A\ncomparison to the published sample of spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at\nz>5.5 reveals that the host of GRB 050904 would evade detection and/or\nconfirmation in any of the current surveys due to the lack of detectable\nLy-alpha emission, which is likely the result of dust extinction (A[1200]~1.5\nmag). This suggests that not all luminous starburst galaxies at z~6 are\ncurrently being accounted for. Most importantly, using the metallicity of\nZ~0.05 solar inferred from the afterglow absorption spectrum, our observations\nindicate for the first time that the observed evolution in the mass- and\nluminosity-metallicity relations from z=0 to z~2 continues on to z>6.

Our new models extend our previous 2D studies (Kim & Ostriker\n2002), which showed that a magnetized spiral shock in a thin disk can undergo\nmagneto-Jeans instability (MJI), resulting in interarm spur structures and\nmassive fragments. Similar spur features have recently been seen in\nhigh-resolution observations of several galaxies. Here, we consider two sets of\nnumerical models: 2D models that use a thick-disk gravitational kernel, and 3D\nruns with explicit vertical stratification. When disks are sufficiently\nmagnetized and self-gravitating, the result in both sorts of models is the\ngrowth of spiral-arm substructure similar to that in our previous razor-thin\nmodels. Reduced self-gravity in thick disks increases the spur spacing to ~10\ntimes the Jeans length at the arm peak. Bound clouds that form from spur\nfragmentation have masses ~(1-3)x10^7 Msun each, a factor ~3-8 times larger\nthan in razor-thin models with the same gas surface density and stellar spiral\narm strength. We find that unmagnetized or weakly magnetized 2D models are\nunstable to the wiggle instability (WI) previously identified by Wada & Koda\n(2004), and proposed as a potential spur- and clump-forming mechanism.\nHowever,our fully 3D models do not show this effect. Non-steady motions and\nstrong vertical shear prevent coherent vortical structures from forming,\nevidently suppressing the WI that appears in 2D (isothermal) runs. We also find\nno clear traces of Parker instability in the nonlinear spiral arm substructures\nthat emerge (in self-gravitating models), although conceivably Parker modes may\nhelp seed the MJI at early stages since azimuthal wavelengths are similar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2006 06:28:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We have searched the dusty, lensed, hyperluminous quasar,\nAPM08279+5255, for the 1612-, 1665- and 1667-MHz hydroxyl lines as well as the\n22-GHz water line. At z = 3.9 these are shifted to 329, 340 and 4,538MHz. Our\nrelatively shallow test data reveal no convincing maser activity but we set a\nmeaningful constraint on the OH maser luminosity and we approach the expected\nthermal noise levels, meaning progress is possible. As an aside, we present\ndeep new submm and radio imaging of this field. Using a simple shift-and-add\ntechnique we uncover a new submm galaxy, conceivably at the redshift of\nAPM08279+5255.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2006 11:32:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2006 14:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this framework, worldlines are\ntraced out through the parameterized evolution of spacetime events, advancing\nor retreating with respect to the laboratory clock, with negative energy\ntrajectories appearing as antiparticles when the observer describes the\nevolution using the laboratory clock. The associated gauge theory describes\nlocal interactions between events (correlated by the invariant parameter)\nmediated by five off-shell gauge fields. These gauge fields are shown to\ntransform tensorially under under space and time reflections, unlike the\nstandard Maxwell fields, and the interacting quantum theory therefore remains\nmanifestly Lorentz covariant. Charge conjugation symmetry in the quantum theory\nis achieved by simultaneous reflection of the sense of evolution and the fifth\nscalar field. Applying this procedure to the classical gauge theory leads to a\npurely classical manifestation of charge conjugation, placing the CPT\nsymmetries on the same footing in the classical and quantum domains.

What are ``normal'' growth patterns in\nsocial, technological, and information networks? Many studies have discovered\npatterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a\nlarge network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy\ntails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena,\nand others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over\nlong periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about\ntrends over time.\n  Here we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising\nphenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of\nedges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average\ndistance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional\nwisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of\nthe number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log n)).\n  Existing graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even\nat a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a ``forest\nfire'' spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires\nvery few parameters (like the ``flammability'' of nodes), and produces graphs\nexhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the\npresent study.\n  We also notice that the ``forest fire'' model exhibits a sharp transition\nbetween sparse graphs and graphs that are densifying.

The conventional\ndynamic formalism, obtained for the space-time, where the motion of free\nparticles is primordially deterministic, seems to be unsuitable. The\nstatistical ensemble of stochastic (or deterministic) systems is considered to\nbe the main object of dynamics. At such a logical reloading the statistical\ndescription becomes a component of dynamics, and capacities of dynamics\nincrease. At such an approach one can describe deterministic, stochastic and\nquantum particles by means of the uniform technique. The quantum particle is\ndescribed as a stochastic particle, i.e. without a reference to the quantum\nprinciples. Besides, by means of this technique one can describe classical\ninviscid fluid. There are four different versions of the formalism: (1)\ndescription in Euler dynamic variables, (2) description in Lagrange dynamic\nvariables, (3) description in terms of the generalized stream function, (4)\ndescription in terms of the wave function. The uniform formalism is purely\ndynamic. Even describing stochastic systems, it does not refer to probability\nand probabilistic structures. In relativistic case the uniform formalism can\ndescribe pair production and pair annihilation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Mar 2006 10:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 May 2006 07:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2006 13:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2006 15:54:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 4 Dec 2010 13:12:40 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2010 07:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 18 Mar 2011 08:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-03-21"}

Both involve encoding\ninformation by means of subsystems. One is initialization-based error\nprotection, which involves a quantum operation that is applied before error\nevents occur. The other is operator quantum error correction, which uses a\nrecovery operation applied after the errors. Together, the two approaches make\nit clear how quantum information can be stored at all stages of a process\ninvolving alternating error and quantum operations. In particular, there is\nalways a subsystem that faithfully represents the desired quantum information.\nWe give a definition of faithful realization of quantum information and show\nthat it always involves subsystems. This justifies the \"subsystems principle\"\nfor realizing quantum information. In the presence of errors, one can make use\nof noiseless, (initialization) protectable, or error-correcting subsystems. We\ngive an explicit algorithm for finding optimal noiseless subsystems. Finding\noptimal protectable or error-correcting subsystems is in general difficult.\nVerifying that a subsystem is error-correcting involves only linear algebra. We\ndiscuss the verification problem for protectable subsystems and reduce it to a\nsimpler version of the problem of finding error-detecting codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Mar 2006 22:21:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

That is to\nsay, because the hamiltonian operator generally is the sum of two operators,\nthen it is a difficult task to apply the time evolution operator on an initial\nwave function f(x,0), for it implies to apply terms operators like (a+b)^n. A\npossible solution of this problem is to factorize the time evolution operator\nand then apply successively the individual exponential operator on the initial\nwave function. However, the exponential operator does not directly factorize,\ni. e. Exp{a+b} is not equal to Exp{a}Exp{b}. In this work we present a useful\nprocedure for factorizing the time evolution operator when the argument of the\nexponential is a sum of two operators, which obey specific commutation\nrelations. Then, we apply the exponential operator as an evolution operator for\nthe case of elementary unidimensional potentials, like the particle subject to\na constant force and the harmonic oscillator.
