Two types of models are proposed: (i) images are converted\ninto complex networks by considering pixels as nodes while connections are\nestablished in terms of fields of influence defined by visual features such as\ntangent fields induced by gray-level contrasts and distance; and (ii) image\npixels exhibiting particularly distinctive values of visual properties such as\ngray-level intensity, contrast, size of objects, orientation and texture are\nmapped into nodes and the weights of links are defined in order to favor\ntransitions between regions with similar or different visual features, also\ntaking the distance between the nodes into account. Preferential random walks\nare performed on such networks in order to emulate attentional shifts and eye\nmovements, and the saliency of each region is obtained in terms of the\nfrequency of visits to each node at equilibrium. In the case of the first\nmodel, there is a definite tendency to emphasize not only high curvature points\nbut also convergences of the tangent field.

In particular, we\nhave revealed basic laws, suggesting a cosmo-physical nature of these\nphenomena, in the time series created by the noise generators of the global GCP\nnet. On the basis of all the results obtained, a conclusion has been made that\nthe histogram form is determined by fluctuations of the spacetime, which depend\non the movement of the measured system (laboratory) relative to the heavenly\nbodies. An important step to understand the nature of these phenomena was the\nfinding that at the moments of the new Moon, a specific histogram form appears\npractically simultaneously at different geographical points, from Arctic to\nAntarctic, in middle latitudes of West and East hemispheres. This effect seems\nto be not due to a change of the tide-generating forces; to explain it,\nnontrivial hypotheses are needed. The present paper shows the appearance of\nspecific histogram forms at the culminations of the solar eclipses (moments of\nthe geocentric superposition of the Sun and the Moon), with the eclipse forms\ndiffering from the new-moon ones. Specific histogram forms appear practically\nsimultaneously all over the Earth and depend nor on the geographical\ncoordinates, nor on the nature of the process studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2006 12:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
