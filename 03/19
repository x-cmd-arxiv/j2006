Shocks not only play a decisive role for the\nthermalization of gas in virialising structures but also for the acceleration\nof relativistic cosmic rays (CRs) through diffusive shock acceleration. Our\nformalism is applicable both to ordinary non-relativistic thermal gas, and to\nplasmas composed of CRs and thermal gas. To this end, we derive an analytical\nsolution to the one-dimensional Riemann shock tube problem for a composite\nplasma of CRs and thermal gas. We apply our methods to study the properties of\nstructure formation shocks in high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of the\nLCDM model. We find that most of the energy is dissipated in weak internal\nshocks with Mach numbers M~2 which are predominantly central flow shocks or\nmerger shock waves traversing halo centres. Collapsed cosmological structures\nare surrounded by external shocks with much higher Mach numbers up to M~1000,\nbut they play only a minor role in the energy balance of thermalization. We\nshow that after the epoch of cosmic reionisation the Mach number distribution\nis significantly modified by an efficient suppression of strong external shock\nwaves due to the associated increase of the sound speed of the diffuse gas.\nInvoking a model for CR acceleration in shock waves, we find that the average\nstrength of shock waves responsible for CR energy injection is higher than that\nfor shocks that dominate the thermalization of the gas. When combined with\nradiative dissipation and star formation, our formalism can also be used to\nstudy CR injection by supernova shocks, or to construct models for\nshock-induced star formation in the interstellar medium.
