Several developments not contemplated at the start of the program in 1990\nhave made it necessary to put the summary on H_0 on a broader basis than\noriginally thought, making four preparatory papers necessary. The new Cepheid\ndistances of the subset of 10 galaxies, which were hosts of normal SNeIa, give\nweighted mean luminosities in B, V, and I at maximum light of -19.49, -19.46,\nand -19.22, respectively.

The primary\nmotivation for beginning infrared imaging of the sample was to identify the\nhost galaxies of the ~30% of sources for which the EIS I-band imaging failed to\nproduce a likely candidate. In addition, K-band magnitudes allow photometric\nredshift estimation and I - K colours aid the identification of host galaxies\n(which are typically old, red ellipticals). Of the sources observed in the I\nand K-bands, four remain undetected, possibly indicating high redshifts for the\nhost galaxies, and eight involve complicated radio structures, or several\ncandidate host galaxies, which have yet to be resolved. Thus, the host galaxy\nidentifications are brought to 92% completeness.\n  In conjunction with spectroscopic observations, the K-band magnitudes have\nbeen aperture corrected and used to establish a K-z relation for the CENSORS\nradio galaxies. This relation is of interest because of its variation, at z >\n1, between radio surveys of different flux-density limit. Establishing this\nrelation for CENSORS may shed light on the origin of this variation and will\nallow an appropriate K-z redshift estimator for any CENSORS source which\nremains without a spectroscopic redshift.

We are able to explain the current observed diffuse\ngamma-rays and the very detailed 511 keV annihilation line of secondary\npositrons by $p-p$ collisions of such protons, with appropriate injection times\nand energy. Relativistic protons could have been injected into the ambient\nmaterial if the black hole captured a 50M$_\\odot$ star at several tens million\nyears ago. An alternative possibility is that the black hole continues to\ncapture stars with $\\sim$1M$_\\odot$ every hundred thousand years. Secondary\npositrons produced by $p-p$ collisions at energies $\\ga 30$ MeV are cooled down\nto thermal energies by Coulomb collisions, and annihilate in the warm neutral\nand ionized phases of the interstellar medium with temperatures about several\neV, because the annihilation cross-section reaches its maximum at these\ntemperatures. It takes about ten million years for the positrons to cool down\nto thermal temperatures so they can diffuse into a very large extended region\naround the Galactic center. A much more recent star capture may be also able to\naccount for recent TeV observations within 10 pc of the galactic center as well\nas for the unidentified GeV gamma-ray sources found by EGRET at GC.

It is clear that\nrotation rates at a given age depend strongly on mass; higher mass stars\n(0.4-1.2 M$_\\odot$) have longer periods than lower mass stars and brown dwarfs.\nOn the other hand, specific angular momentum is approximately independent of\nmass for low mass pre-main sequence stars and young brown dwarfs. A spread of\nabout a factor of 30 is seen at any given mass and age. The evolution of\nrotation of solar-like stars during the first 100 Myr is discussed. A broad,\nbimodal distribution exists at the earliest observable phases ($\\sim$1 Myr) for\nstars more massive than 0.4 M$_\\odot$. The rapid rotators (50-60% of the\nsample) evolve to the ZAMS with little or no angular momentum loss.

The electric\ncharges are released by activation of dormant charge carriers in the oxygen\nanion sublattice, called peroxy bonds or positive hole pairs (PHP), where a PHP\nrepresents an $O_3X/^{OO}\\backslash YO_3$ with $X,Y = Si^{4+}, Al^{3+}...$,\ni.e. an $O^-$ in a matrix of $O^{2-}$ of silicates. We propose that PHP are\nactivated by plastic deformations during the slow cooperative build-up of\nstress and the increasingly correlated damage culminating in a large\n``critical'' earthquake. Recent laboratory experiments indeed show that\nstressed rocks form electric batteries which can release their charge when a\nconducting path closes the equivalent electric circuit. We conjecture that the\nintermittent and erratic occurrences of EM signals are a consequence of the\nprogressive build-up of the battery charges in the Earth crust and their\nerratic release when crack networks are percolating throughout the stressed\nrock volumes, providing a conductive pathway for the battery currents to\ndischarge.

Under realistic conditions, the tight confinement causes optical\nemission to be almost entirely directed into the propagating plasmon modes via\na mechanism analogous to cavity quantum electrodynamics. We first illustrate\nthis result for the case of a nanowire, before considering the optimized\ngeometry of a nanotip. We describe an application of this technique involving\nefficient single-photon generation on demand, in which the plasmons are\nefficiently out-coupled to a dielectric waveguide.
