We use high-resolution simulations of idealized cluster mergers to show\nthat they are due to sloshing of the cool gas in the central gravitational\npotential, which is easily set off by minor mergers and can persist for\ngigayears. The only necessary condition is a steep entropy profile, as observed\nin cooling flow clusters. Even if the infalling subcluster has no gas during\ncore passage, the gravitational disturbance sets the main mass peak (gas and\ndark matter together) in motion relative to the surrounding gas. A rapid change\nin the direction of motion causes a change in ram pressure, which pushes the\ncool gas away from the dark matter peak and triggers sloshing. For nonzero\nimpact parameters, the cool gas acquires angular momentum, resulting in a\ncharacteristic spiral pattern of cold fronts. There is little visible\ndisturbance outside the cool core in such a merger. If the subcluster retains\nits gas during core passage, the cool central gas of the main cluster is more\neasily decoupled from the dark matter peak. Subsequently, some of that gas, and\noften the cool gas from the subcluster, falls back to the center and starts\nsloshing. However, in such a merger, global disturbances are readily visible in\nX-rays for a long time.

By using the spectra\nof more than 5000 QSOs from the SDSS we find no evidence for any metallicity\nevolution in the redshift range 2<z<4.5, while there is a significant\nluminosity-metallicity dependence. These results are confirmed by the spectra\nof a smaller sample of narrow line AGNs at high-z (QSO2s and radio galaxies).\nThe lack of metallicity evolution is interpreted both as a consequence of the\ncosmic downsizing and as a selection effect resulting from the joint QSO-galaxy\nevolution. The luminosity-metallicity relation is interpreted as a consequence\nof the mass-metallicity relation in the host galaxies of QSOs, but a\nrelationship with the accretion rate is also possible. The lack of metallicity\nevolution is observed even in the spectra of the most distant QSOs known (z~6).\nThis result is particularly surprising for elements such as Fe, C and Si, which\nare subject to a delayed enrichment, and requires that the hosts of these QSOs\nformed in short bursts and at very high redshift (z>10). The properties of dust\nin high-z QSOs are discussed within the context of the dust production\nmechanisms in the early universe. The dust extinction curve is observed to\nevolve beyond z>4, and by z~6 it is well described by the properties expected\nfor dust produced by SNe, suggesting that the latter is the main mechanism of\ndust production in the early universe. We also show that the huge dust masses\nobserved in distant QSOs can be accounted for by SN dust within the\nobservational constraints currently available.

When CSIT is obtained by feedback, it is\npractical to assume that the channel state feedback rate is finite and the CSIT\nis not perfect. For such a system, we consider beamforming and power on/off\nstrategy for its simplicity and near optimality, where power on/off means that\na beamforming vector (beam) is either turned on with a constant power or turned\noff. The main contribution of this paper is to accurately evaluate the\ninformation rate as a function of the channel state feedback rate. Name a beam\nturned on as an on-beam and the minimum number of the transmit and receive\nantennas as the dimension of a MIMO system. We prove that the ratio of the\noptimal number of on-beams and the system dimension converges to a constant for\na given signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the numbers of transmit and receive\nantennas approach infinity simultaneously and when beamforming is perfect.\nAsymptotic formulas are derived to evaluate this ratio and the corresponding\ninformation rate per dimension. The asymptotic results can be accurately\napplied to finite dimensional systems and suggest a power on/off strategy with\na constant number of on-beams. For this suboptimal strategy, we take a novel\napproach to introduce power efficiency factor, which is a function of the\nfeedback rate, to quantify the effect of imperfect beamforming. By combining\npower efficiency factor and the asymptotic formulas for perfect beamforming\ncase, the information rate of the power on/off strategy with a constant number\nof on-beams is accurately characterized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2006 17:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

For an analytic potential v, we show that\nthe resulting complex system admits a description in terms of the phase space\nR^4 equipped with an unconventional symplectic structure. This in turn allows\nfor the construction of an equivalent real description that is based on the\nconventional symplectic structure on R^4, and establishes the equivalence of\nthe complex extension of classical mechanics that is based on the\nabove-mentioned analytic continuation with the conventional classical\nmechanics. The equivalent real Hamiltonian turns out to be twice the real part\nof H, while the imaginary part of H plays the role of an independent integral\nof motion ensuring the integrability of the system. The equivalent real\ndescription proposed here is the classical analog of the equivalent Hermitian\ndescription of unitary quantum systems defined by complex, typically\nPT-symmetric, potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2006 12:14:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2006 11:26:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Modulating every second period of\nthe potential, the original Bloch band splits into two subbands. The dynamics\nof quantum particles shows a coherent superposition of Bloch oscillations and\nZener tunneling between the subbands, a Bloch-Zener oscillation. Such a system\nis modelled by a tight-binding Hamiltonian, a system of two minibands with an\neasily controllable gap. The dynamics of the system is investigated by using an\nalgebraic ansatz leading to a differential equation of Whittaker-Hill type. It\nis shown that the parameters of the system can be tuned to generate a periodic\nreconstruction of the wave packet and thus of the occupation probability. As an\napplication, the construction of a matter wave beam splitter and a Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Mar 2006 13:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
