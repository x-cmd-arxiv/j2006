As the magnetic field is\nincreased the resistivity increases, reaches a maximum at the metamagnetic\ncritical field, and falls precipitously for fields just above the transition,\nwhile the amplitude of all measurable dHvA frequencies are significantly\nattenuated near the metamagnetic critical field. However, the dHvA frequencies\nand cyclotron masses are not substantially altered by the transition. In the\nlow field state, the resistivity is observed to increase toward low\ntemperatures in a singular fashion, a behavior that is rapidly suppressed above\nthe transition. Instead, in the high field state, the resistivity monotonically\nincreases with temperature with a dependence that is more singular than the\niconic Fermi-liquid, temperature-squared, behavior.

Results obtained with two different methods\nare compared. One is to consider a cluster as a collection of many atoms and\nevaluate the sum of two-body and three-body interatomic interactions, a common\nassumption. The other method, valid at large separation, is to consider each\ncluster as a point particle, characterized by a polarizability tensor, and\nevaluate the inter-cluster interaction. This method employs the static\npolarizability, evaluated by including all many-body (MB) intra-cluster atomic\ninteractions self-consistently, which yields the full inter-cluster\ninteraction, including all MB terms. A comparison of the results from the two\nmethods reveals that the contribution of the higher-than-three-body MB\ninteractions is always attractive and non-negligible, with a relative\nimportance that varies with geometry. The procedure is quite general and is\napplicable to any shape or size of dielectric clusters, in principle. We\npresent numerical results for clusters composed of atoms with polarizability\nconsistent with silica, for which the higher-than-three-body MB correction term\ncan be as high as 42% of the atomic pair-wise sum.

The\nanalysis of weighted properties shows that centrality driven attacks are\ncapable to shatter the network's communication or transport properties even at\nvery low level of damage in the connectivity pattern. The inclusion of weight\nand traffic therefore provides evidence for the extreme vulnerability of\ncomplex networks to any targeted strategy and need to be considered as key\nfeatures in the finding and development of defensive strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Mar 2006 14:56:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
