Two incarnations of this\nfundamental plane have so far been suggested using different underlying models\nand using two different samples of accreting black holes. We present revised\nsamples for both studies together with a refined statistical analysis using\nmeasured errors of the observables. This method is used to compare the two\nsamples, discuss selection effects, and infer parameters for the fundamental\nplane in a homogeneous way. We show that strongly sub-Eddington objects in a\nstate equivalent to the low/hard state of X-ray binaries follow the fundamental\nplane very tightly; the scatter is comparable to the measurement errors.\nHowever, we find that the estimated parameters depend strongly on the\nassumptions made on the sources of scatter and the relative weight of the\ndifferent AGN classes in the sample. Using only hard state objects, the\nfundamental plane is in agreement with the prediction of a simple uncooled\nsynchrotron/jet model for the emitted radiation. Inclusion of high-state\nobjects increases the scatter and moves the correlation closer to a disk/jet\nmodel. This is qualitatively consistent with a picture where low-state objects\nare largely dominated by jet emission while high-state objects have a strong\ncontribution from an accretion disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Mar 2006 16:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

There are two different\ntypes of hard/soft transition, those where the spectrum softens at all\nenergies, leading to a diagonal track on a colour-colour diagram, and those\nwhere only the higher energy spectrum softens, giving a vertical track. The\nluminosity at which the transition occurs is correlated with this spectral\nbehaviour, with the vertical transition at L/L_Edd ~0.02 while the diagonal one\nis at ~0.1.

These shocks are associated with an\nunstable, chaotic wind. The main improvement with respect to earlier models is\nthe inclusion of the radial dependence of the shock velocity jump and\ncompression ratio, based on 1D hydrodynamical simulations. The decrease of the\nvelocity jump and the compression ratio as a function of radius produces a\nrapidly decreasing synchrotron emissivity. This effectively prohibits the\nmodels from reproducing the spectral shape of the observed non-thermal radio\nemission. We investigate a number of \"escape routes\" by which the\nhydrodynamical predictions might be reconciled with the radio observations.\nAlthough these escape routes reproduce the observed spectral shape, none of\nthese escape routes are physically plausible. In particular, re-acceleration by\nfeeding an electron distribution through a number of shocks, is in\ncontradiction with current hydrodynamical simulations.

At present, it\nis not feasible to perform 2D simulations of the wind out to the distances\nrequired for synchrotron-emission models. Based on the current hydrodynamic\nmodels, we suspect that the observed non-thermal radio emission from O stars\ncannot be explained by wind-embedded shocks associated with the instability of\nthe line-driving mechanism.

Our data result from two different experiments performed,\ncalibrated, and analyzed in similar ways. A CII survey was made at 3.5 cm\nwavelength to obtain accurate measurements of carbon radio recombination lines.\nWhen combined with atomic (CI) and molecular (CO) data, these measurements will\nconstrain the composition, structure, kinematics, and physical properties of\nthe photodissociation regions that lie on the edges of HII regions. A second\nsurvey was made at 3.5 cm wavelength to determine the abundance of 3He in the\ninterstellar medium of the Milky Way. Together with measurements of the 3He+\nhyperfine line we get high precision RRL parameters for H, 4He, and C. Here we\ndiscuss significant improvements in these data, with both longer integrations\nand newly observed sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2006 14:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

As an exception Skyrme's model succeeded to\ndescribe nuclear particles as localized states, so-called 'skyrmions', within a\nnon-linear field theory. Skyrmions are a characteristic of non-linear continuum\nmodels ranging from microscopic to cosmological scales. Skyrmionic states have\nbeen found under non-equilibrium conditions, or when stabilised by external\nfields or the proliferation of topological defects.

In this paper, we study the problem in the randomized and quantum\nquery models and give new lower and upper bound techniques in both models.\n  The lower bound technique works for any graph that contains a product graph\nas a subgraph. Applying it to the Boolean hypercube {0,1}^n and the constant\ndimensional grids [n]^d, two particular product graphs that recently drew much\nattention, we get the following tight results:\n  RLS({0,1}^n) = \\Theta(2^{n/2}n^{1/2}), QLS({0,1}^n) = \\Theta(2^{n/3}n^{1/6}),\n  RLS([n]^d) = \\Theta(n^{d/2}) for d \\geq 4, QLS([n]^d) = \\Theta(n^{d/3}) for d\n\\geq 6.\n  Here RLS(G) and QLS(G) are the randomized and quantum query complexities of\nLocal Search on G, respectively. These improve the previous results by Aaronson\n[STOC'04], Ambainis (unpublished) and Santha and Szegedy [STOC'04].\n  Our new algorithms work well when the underlying graph expands slowly. As an\napplication to [n]^2, a new quantum algorithm using O(\\sqrt{n}(\\log\\log\nn)^{1.5}) queries is given. This improves the previous best known upper bound\nof O(n^{2/3}) (Aaronson, [STOC'04]), and implies that Local Search on grids\nexhibits different properties in low dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Mar 2006 00:21:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A distinct characteristic of the\npresent generalization is that the formulation for higher dimensional systems\nis invariant under permutation of the subsystems, hence is employed as a\ncriterion to test the existence of genuine tripartite entanglement.\nFurthermore, the formulation for pure states can be conveniently extended to\nthe case of mixed states by utilizing the kronecker product approximate\ntechnique.
