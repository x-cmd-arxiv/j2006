The transits of a\nsolitary planet orbiting a star occur at equally spaced intervals in time. If a\nsecond planet is present, dynamical interactions within the system will cause\nthe time interval between transits to vary. These transit time variations can\nbe used to infer the orbital elements of the unseen, perturbing planet. I show\nanalytic expressions for the amplitude of the transit time variations in\nseveral limiting cases. Under certain conditions the transit time variations\ncan be comparable to the period of the transiting planet. I also present the\napplication of this planet detection technique to existing transit observations\nof the TrES-1 and HD209458 systems. While no convincing evidence for a second\nplanet in either system was found from those data, I constrain the mass that a\nperturbing planet could have as a function of the semi-major axis ratio of the\ntwo planets and the eccentricity of the perturbing planet. Near low-order,\nmean-motion resonances (within about 1% fractional deviation), I find that a\nsecondary planet must generally have a mass comparable to or less than the mass\nof the Earth--showing that these data are the first to have sensitivity to sub\nEarth-mass planets orbiting main sequence stars. These results show that TTV\nwill be an important tool in the detection and characterization of extrasolar\nplanetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2006 18:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We have developed software to\nsimulate the observed line and continuum properties of synthetic LAEs in the\ndistant universe by adopting various typical observational techniques.

None of the techniques studied are\ngreatly susceptible to underlying stellar populations or the contribution of\nnebular gas. We find that techniques that use one off-line filter on the red\nside of Lya result in highly inaccurate measurements of W_Lya. Adopting two\noff-line filters to estimate continuum at Lya is an improvement but is still\nunreliable when dust extinction is considered. Techniques that employ single\nnarrow- and broad-band filters with the same central wavelength are not\nsusceptible to internal dust, but IGM Lya absorption can cause W_Lya to be\noverestimated by factors of up to 2: at z=6, the median W_Lya is overestimated\nby ~25%. The most robust approach is a SED fitting technique that fits E(B-V)\nand burst-age from synthetic models - broadband observations are needed that\nsample the UV continuum slope, 2175AA dust feature, and the 4000AA\ndiscontinuity.

FLUX has significant scaling advantages over\nconventional models: for ``magnetic carpet'' models, with photospheric\nline-tied boundary conditions, FLUX simulations scale in complexity like a\nconventional 2-D grid although the full 3-D field is represented. The code is\nfree software and is available online. In this current paper we introduce\nfluxons and our prototype code, and describe the course of future work with the\ncode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2006 20:22:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

RESULTS:It is shown that in a star-disc\nencounter the angular momentum loss is usually larger than the mass loss, so\nthat the disc remnant has a lower specific angular momentum. Assuming an age of\n1-2 Myr for the ONC, the disc angular momentum in the higher density region of\nthe Trapezium is reduced by 15-20% on average. Encounters therefore play an\nimportant part in the angular momentum transport in these central regions but\nare not the dominant process. More importantly, even in the outer cluster\nregions the angular momentum loss is on average 3-5%.

It is shown first that the observed MD,\ndesigned with standard methods, is more fit to a closed-box model than to the\ninfall MD. We argue that this is due to the specific contribution of the thick\ndisc population, which has been overlooked both in the derivation of the\nobserved MD and in the standard chemical evolution models. Although this\nagreement disqualifies the MD as the best supportive evidence for infall, we\nargue that the evolution must be more complex than described by either the\nclosed-box or the standard infall models. A new age-metallicity distribution is\nobtained, where particularities of the previous recent determinations are\nphased out. The new AMR shows a mean increase limited to about a factor of 2 in\nZ over the disc age. It is shown that below 3 Gyrs, the dispersion in\nmetallicity is about 0.1 dex, which, (given the observational uncertainties),\nis compatible with the small cosmic dispersion measured on the interstellar\nmedium and meteoritic pre-solar dust grains. A population that is progressively\nolder and more metal rich arises at a metallicity greater than that of the\nHyades, to reach [Fe/H] ~ +0.5 dex at ages > 5 Gyr. We suggest that this is\nbest explained by radial migration. A symmetrical widening towards lower\nmetallicities is seen at about the same age. Finally, the new derived ages are\nsufficiently consistent that an AMR within the thick disc is confirmed.

However, at [Ca/H] >= -2, NLTE abundance\ncorrection of individual lines may be small in absolute value due to the\ndifferent influence of NLTE effects on line wings and the line core. At lower\nCa abundances, NLTE leads to systematically depleted total absorption in the\nline and positive abundance corrections, exceeding +0.5 dex for Ca I 4226 at\n[Ca/H] = -4.9. In contrast, NLTE effects strengthen the Ca II lines and lead to\nnegative abundance corrections. NLTE corrections are small, <= 0.02 dex, for\nthe Ca II resonance lines. For the IR lines of multiplet 3d - 4p, they grow in\nabsolute value with decreasing Ca abundance exceeding 0.4 dex in metal-poor\nstars with [Fe/H] <= -3.

V616 Mon is the proto-typical soft\nx-ray transient containing a black hole primary. As such it is important to\nconstrain the masses of the binary components. The modeling of the infrared\nobservations of ellipsoidal variations in this system lead to a derived mass of\n11.0 M$_{\\sun}$ for the black hole. The validity of this derivation has been\ncalled into question due to the possiblity that the secondary star's spectral\nenergy distribution is contaminated by accretion disk emission (acting to\ndilute the variations). Our new $K$-band spectrum of V616 Mon reveals a\nlate-type K dwarf secondary star, but one that has very weak $^{\\rm 12}$CO\nabsorption features. Comparison of V616 Mon with SS Cyg leads us to estimate\nthat the accretion disk supplies only a small amount of $K$-band flux, and the\nellipsoidal variations are not seriously contaminated. If true, the derived\norbital inclination of V616 Mon is not greatly altered, and the mass of the\nblack hole remains large. A preliminary stellar atmosphere model for the\n$K$-band spectrum of V616 Mon reveals that the carbon abundance is\napproximately 50% of the solar value. We conclude that the secondary star in\nV616 Mon has either suffered serious contamination from the accretion of\nsupernova ejecta that created the black hole primary, or it is the stripped\nremains of a formerly more massive secondary star, one in which the CNO cycle\nhad been active.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2006 15:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here, we start with Mohr-Coulomb\nplasticity for quasi-2D granular materials to calculate (average) stresses and\nslip planes, but we propose a \"stochastic flow rule\" (SFR) to replace the\nprinciple of coaxiality in classical plasticity. The SFR takes into account two\ncrucial features of granular materials - discreteness and randomness - via\ndiffusing \"spots\" of local fluidization, which act as carriers of plasticity.\nWe postulate that spots perform random walks biased along slip-lines with a\ndrift direction determined by the stress imbalance upon a local switch from\nstatic to dynamic friction. In the continuum limit (based on a Fokker-Planck\nequation for the spot concentration), this simple model is able to predict a\nvariety of granular flow profiles in flat-bottom silos, annular Couette cells,\nflowing heaps, and plate-dragging experiments -- with essentially no fitting\nparameters -- although it is only expected to function where material is at\nincipient failure and slip-lines are inadmissible. For special cases of\nadmissible slip-lines, such as plate dragging under a heavy load or flow down\nan inclined plane, we postulate a transition to rate-dependent Bagnold\nrheology, where flow occurs by sliding shear planes. With different yield\ncriteria, the SFR provides a general framework for multiscale modeling of\nplasticity in amorphous materials, cycling between continuum limit-state stress\ncalculations, meso-scale spot random walks, and microscopic particle\nrelaxation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2006 08:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2006 21:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

In this paper we study possible solutions to\nthis problem by considering five-dimensional theories where the Higgs field\npotential vanishes at tree level due to a global symmetry. We consider two\navenues: a Little Higgs model and a Twin Higgs model. An obstacle for the\nembedding of these four-dimensional models in five dimensions is that their\nlogarithmic sensitivity to the cutoff will result in linear divergences in the\nhigher dimensional theory. We show that, despite the increased cutoff\nsensitivity of higher dimensional theories, it is possible to control the Higgs\nmass in these two scenarios. For the Little Higgs model studied, the\nphenomenology will be significantly different from the case of the standard\nmodel in UED. This is due to the fact that the compactification scale\napproximately coincides with the scale where the masses of the new states\nappear. For the case of the Twin Higgs model, the compactification scale may be\nconsiderably lower than the scale where the new states appear. If it is as low\nas allowed by current limits, it would be possible to experimentally observe\nthe standard model Kaluza-Klein states as well as a new heavy quark.

The main problem is complex\nNavier-Stokes equations and turbulence in complex spaces. The necessity of\nintroducing complex spaces in hydrodynamics is deter-mined by the mechanism of\ntransition of a laminar flow into a turbulent flow. The author pro-poses a\nnon-traditional scenario of the transition: the cause of turbulence is in\ndestruction (cessation of existence) of a laminar flow. The article contains\nthe mathematical rationale for the necessity of development of the theory of\nturbulence in the complex configurational space: the complex configurational\nspace is the natural area of existence of turbulence. Hydrody-namic flows are\nregarded as flows on entropy manifolds that [flows] are supported by the two\nsymmetries: the symmetry of conservation of general entropy and the symmetry of\nduality of impulse representation. The new symmetry has been introduced and\nstudied: the forminvari-ance of Helmholtz matrix of impulse density. The strict\nfoundation has been provided for the known fact of chaotic mechanics:\nappearance of the new structure (a turbulent flow) is a result of interaction\nof two entities: dissipation and vorticity. On the deep level the phenomenology\nof turbulence in complex spaces is based on the transition from the mechanics\nof a material point to the mechanics of an oriented material point, that\n[transition] takes place in a current period of time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2006 12:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
