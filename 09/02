This approach\ninserts the inflationary slow roll parameters directly into a Monte Carlo\nMarkov chain estimate of the cosmological parameters, and uses the inflationary\nflow hierarchy to compute the parameters' scale-dependence. We work with the\nfirst three parameters (epsilon, eta and xi) and pay close attention to the\npossibility that the 3 year WMAP dataset contains evidence for a ``running''\nspectral index, which is dominated by the xi term. Mirroring the WMAP team's\nanalysis we find that the permitted distribution of xi is broad, and centered\naway from zero. However, when we require that inflationary parameters yield at\nleast 30 additional e-folds of inflation after the largest observable scales\nleave the horizon, the bounds on xi tighten dramatically. We make use of the\nabsence of an explicit pivot scale in the slow roll reconstruction formalism to\ndetermine the dependence of the computed parameter distributions on the pivot.\nWe show that the choice of pivot has a significant effect on the inferred\nconstraints on the inflationary variables, and the spectral index and running\nderived from them. Finally, we argue that the next round of cosmological data\ncan be expected to place very stringent constraints on the region of parameter\nspace open to single field models of slow roll inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2006 17:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2006 15:55:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2006 16:01:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-12"}

We develop a\nperturbation approach to derive the condensate wavefunction for an amplitude of\nthe potential smaller than the chemical potential of the condensate and for an\narbitrary spatial variation scale of the potential. Applying this theory to\ndisordered potentials, we find in particular that, if the healing length is\nsmaller than the correlation length of the disorder, the condensate assumes a\ndelocalized Thomas-Fermi profile. In the opposite situation where the\ncorrelation length is smaller than the healing length, we show that the random\npotential can be significantly smoothed and, in the meanfield regime, the\ncondensate wavefunction can remain delocalized, even for very small correlation\nlengths of the disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2006 07:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2006 05:58:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2006 09:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Nov 2006 12:55:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Since muons at the ILC are often produced\nwith or in jets, for many of the physics channels of interest[1], an efficient\nalgorithm to deal with the identification and separation of particles within\njets is important. The algorithm at the core of the method accounts for the\neffects of the magnetic field and for the loss of energy by charged particles\ndue to ionization in the detector. We have chosen to develop the analysis\nwithin the setup of one of the Linear Collider Concept Detectors adopted by the\nUS. Within b-pair production jets, particles cover a wide range in momenta;\nhowever ~ 80% of the particles have a momentum below 30 GeV[2]. Our study,\nfocused on bbar-b jets, is preceded by a careful analysis of single energy\nparticles between 2 and 50 GeV. As medium energy particles are a substantial\ncomponent of the jets, many of the particles lose part of their energy in the\ncalorimeters and the solenoid coil before reaching the muon detector where they\nmay have energy below 2 GeV. To deal with this problem we have implemented a\nRunge-Kutta correction of the calculated trajectory to better handle these\nlower energy particles. The multiple scattering and other stochastic processes,\nmore important at lower energy, is addressed by a Kalman-filter integrated into\nthe reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm provides a unique and powerful\nseparation of muons from pions. The 5 Tesla magnetic field from a solenoid\nsurrounds the hadron calorimeter and allows the reconstruction and precision\nmomentum measurement down to a few GeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2006 06:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

However, the most frequent gene tree, termed\n\"maximum gene-support tree\" (MGS tree, or WMGS tree for the weighted one), in\nyeasts, baculoviruses, or plants was consistently found to be the \"true tree\"\namong the species. The results provide insights into the overall degree of\ndivergence of orthologous genes of the genomes analyzed and suggest the\nfollowing: 1) The true tree relationship among the species studied is still\nmaintained by the largest group of orthologous genes; 2) There are usually more\northologous genes with higher similarities between genetically closer species\nthan between genetically more distant ones; and 3) The maximum gene-support\ntree refl ects the phylogenetic relationship among species in comparison.\n  Keywords: genome, gene evolution, molecular phylogeny, true tree\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Sep 2006 14:20:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2006 03:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 7 Jun 2008 21:21:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-09"}

However, no comparable formulas are available for the volumes (and,\nhence, probabilities) of various separable subsets of them.

Making use of the density matrix (rho)\nparameterization of Bloore (J. Phys.

The associated\nintegrand in each case is the product of a known (highly oscillatory near nu=1)\njacobian and a certain unknown univariate function, which our extensive\nnumerical (quasi-Monte Carlo) computations indicate is very closely\nproportional to an (incomplete) beta function B_{nu}(a,b), with a=1/2,\nb=sqrt{3}in the real case, and a=2 sqrt{6}/5, b =3/sqrt{2} in the complex case.\nAssuming the full applicability of these specific incomplete beta functions, we\nundertake separable volume calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2006 16:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2006 16:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
