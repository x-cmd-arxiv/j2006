For the case of Fe films on Au(100), we study the wave vector\ndependence of the linewidth of the lowest frequency mode, to find that it\ncontains a term which varies as the fourth power of the wave vector. It is\nargued that this behavior is expected quite generally. We also explore the\nnature of the eigenvectors of the two lowest lying modes of the film, as a\nfunction of wave vector. Interestingly, as wave vector increases, the lowest\nmode localizes onto the interface between the film and the substrate, while the\nsecond mode evolves into a surface spin wave, localized on the outer layer. We\ninfer similar behavior for a Co film on Cu(100), though this evolution occurs\nat rather larger wave vectors where, as we have shown previously, the modes are\nheavily damped with the consequence that identification of distinct eigenmodes\nis problematical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2006 00:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The purpose here is not just\nto understand what determines the final prices of art objects, but also the\nprice movement during the entire auction. We identify several factors, such as\nartist characteristics (established or emerging artist; prior sales history),\nart characteristics (size; painting medium--canvas or paper), competition\ncharacteristics (current number of bidders; current number of bids) and auction\ndesign characteristics (opening bid; position of the lot in the auction), that\nexplain the dynamics of price movement in an on-line art auction. We find that\nthe effects on price vary over the duration of the auction, with some of these\neffects being stronger at the beginning of the auction (such as the opening bid\nand historical prices realized). In some cases, the rate of change in prices\n(velocity) increases at the end of the auction (for canvas paintings and\npaintings by established artists). Our analysis suggests that the opening bid\nis positively related to on-line auction price levels of art at the beginning\nof the auction, but its effect declines toward the end of the auction. The\norder in which the lots appear in an art auction is negatively related to the\ncurrent price level, with this relationship decreasing toward the end of the\nauction. This implies that lots that appear earlier have higher current prices\nduring the early part of the auction, but that effect diminishes by the end of\nthe auction. Established artists show a positive relationship with the price\nlevel at the beginning of the auction. Reputation or popularity of the artists\nand their investment potential as assessed by previous history of sales are\npositively related to the price levels at the beginning of the auction. The\nmedium (canvas or paper) of the painting does not show any relationship with\nart auction price levels, but the size of the painting is negatively related to\nthe current price during the early part of the auction.

We find the\ncontributions to the spectral density from each component of the chromophore\nenvironment: the bulk solvent, protein, and water bound to the protein.
