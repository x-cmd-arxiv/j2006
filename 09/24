The primary aim of this work is to demonstrate the\ncoronagraphic performance of checkerboard masks down to a $10^{-6}$\npeak-to-peak contrast, which is required to detect self-luminous extra-solar\nplanets in the mid-infrared region. Two masks, consisting of aluminum films on\na glass substrates, were manufactured using nano-fabrication techniques with\nelectron beam lithography: one mask was optimized for a pupil with a 30%\ncentral obstruction and the other was for a pupil without obstruction. The\ntheoretical contrast for both masks was $10^{-7}$ and no adaptive optics system\nwas employed. For both masks, the observed point spread functions were quite\nconsistent with the theoretical ones. The average contrast measured within the\ndark regions was $2.7 {\\times} 10^{-7}$ and $1.1 {\\times} 10^{-7}$. The\ncoronagraphic performance significantly outperformed the $10^{-6}$ requirement\nand almost reached the theoretical limit determined by the mask designs. We\ndiscuss the potential application of checkerboard masks for mid-infrared\ncoronagraphy, and conclude that binary masks are promising for future\nhigh-contrast space telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2006 17:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
