The data can be interpreted\nby collimated emission in a jet with a typical value of $p$ = 2.4 which is\nmoving in an homogeneous interstellar medium and with a cooling frequency\nnu_{c} still above the X-rays at 0.5 days after the burst onset. GRB 051028 can\nbe classified as a ``gray'' or ``potentially dark'' GRB. On the basis of the\ncombined optical and Swift/XRT data, we conclude that the reason for the\noptical dimness is not extra absorption in the host galaxy, but rather the GRB\ntaking place at high-redshift.We also notice the very striking similarity with\nthe optical lightcurve of GRB 050730, a burst with a spectroscopic redshift of\n3.967, although GRB 051028 is about 3 mag fainter.

The non-detection of the host galaxy down to R = 25.1 is also consistent\nwith the burst arising at high redshift, compatible with the published pseudo-z\nof 3.7 +/- 1.8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Sep 2006 17:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Such a procedure, using enlarged in fact a number of observables,\nenables us to determine relatively precise ages and other crucial\ncharacteristics of the analyzed sources. The resulting age estimates agree very\nwell with those obtained by means of `classical' spectral ageing method for\nobjects not older than 10 Myr, for which good-quality spectral data are\navailable. The presented method is however also applicable in the case of the\nsources older than this, and/or the ones for which the only available\nlow-resolution radio data do not allow for detailed spectral ageing studies.\nOur analysis indicates that the main factor precluding precise age\ndetermination for FR II type radio galaxies regards the poorly known shape of\nthe initial electron energy distribution injected by the jet terminal shocks to\nthe expanding lobes/cocoons. We briefly consider this issue, and conclude that\nthe broad-band single power-law form assumed here may be accurate enough for\nthe presented estimates, although most likely it does not strictly correspond\nto some well-defined realistic particle acceleration process.

The\nsuccessful discrimination of protein folds would help to improve the accuracy\nof protein 3D structure prediction. Results: In this work, we propose a method\nbased on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) for recognizing proteins belonging\nto 30 different folds using the occurrence of amino acid residues in a set of\n1612 proteins. The present method could discriminate the globular proteins from\n30 major folding types with the sensitivity of 37%, which is comparable to or\nbetter than other methods in the literature. A web server has been developed\nfor predicting the folding type of the protein from amino acid sequence and it\nis available at http://granular.com/PROLDA/. Conclusions:Linear discriminant\nanalysis based on amino acid occurrence could successfully recognize protein\nfolds. The present method has several advantages such as, (i) it directly\npredicts the folding type of a protein without performing pair-wise\ncomparisons, (ii) it can discriminate folds among large number of proteins and\n(iii) it is very fast to obtain the results.

Contrary to folklore, the\ninterpretation question was not settled at this conference and no consensus was\nreached; instead, a range of sharply conflicting views were presented and\nextensively discussed. Today, there is no longer an established or dominant\ninterpretation of quantum theory, so it is important to re-evaluate the\nhistorical sources and keep the interpretation debate open. In this spirit, we\nprovide a complete English translation of the original proceedings (lectures\nand discussions), and give background essays on the three main interpretations\npresented: de Broglie's pilot-wave theory, Born and Heisenberg's quantum\nmechanics, and Schroedinger's wave mechanics. We provide an extensive analysis\nof the lectures and discussions that took place, in the light of current\ndebates about the meaning of quantum theory. The proceedings contain much\nunexpected material, including extensive discussions of de Broglie's pilot-wave\ntheory (which de Broglie presented for a many-body system), and a \"quantum\nmechanics\" apparently lacking in wave function collapse or fundamental time\nevolution. We hope that the book will contribute to the ongoing revival of\nresearch in quantum foundations, as well as stimulate a reconsideration of the\nhistorical development of quantum physics.

The uncertainty principle\nis shown to appear in three manifestations, in the form of uncertainty\nrelations: for the widths of the position and momentum distributions in any\nquantum state; for the inaccuracies of any joint measurement of these\nquantities; and for the inaccuracy of a measurement of one of the quantities\nand the ensuing disturbance in the distribution of the other quantity.
