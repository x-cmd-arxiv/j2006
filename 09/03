Clusters with a smaller initial separation\ntend to merge in $\\aplt 60$ Myr due to loss of angular momentum from escaping\nstars. Clusters with a larger initial separation tend to become even more\nwidely separated due to mass loss from the evolving stellar populations. The\nearly orbital evolution of a binary cluster is governed by mass loss from the\nevolving stellar population and by loss of angular momentum from escaping\nstars. Mass loss by stellar winds and supernovae explosions in the first $\\sim\n30$ Myr causes the binary to expand and the orbit to become eccentric. The\ninitially less massive cluster expands more quickly than the binary separation\nincreases, and is therefore bound to initiate mass transfer to the more massive\ncluster. This process is quite contrary to stellar binaries in which the more\nmassive star tends to initiate mass transfer. Since mass transfer proceeds on a\nthermal timescale from the less massive to the more massive cluster, this\nsemi-detached phase is quite stable, even in an eccentric orbit until the\norbital separation reaches the gyration radius of the two clusters, at which\npoint both clusters merge to one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Sep 2006 12:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In\nparticular they prevent true long range phase order from forming in one\ndimensional condensates, even at zero temperature. Nevertheless, by dynamically\nsplitting the condensate into two parallel decoupled tubes, a macroscopic\nrelative phase, can be imposed on the system. This kind of setup can serve as a\nmatter wave interferometer, which relies on the interference between the\ndisplaced condensates as a measure of the relative phase between them. Here we\nshow how the quantum phase fluctuations, which are so effective in equilibrium,\nact to destroy the macroscopic relative phase that was imposed as a non\nequilibrium initial condition of the interferometer. We show that the phase\ncoherence between the two condensates decays exponentially with a dephasing\ntime that depends on intrinsic parameters: the dimensionless interaction\nstrength, sound velocity and density. Interestingly, at low temperatures the\ndephasing time is almost independent of temperature. At temperatures higher\nthan a crossover scale T* dephasing gains significant temperature dependance.\nIn contrast to the usual phase diffusion, which is essentially an effect of\nconfinement, the dephasing due to fluctuations in one dimension is a bulk\neffect that survives the thermodynamic limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Sep 2006 11:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The heights are\nassociated with the sheets of the Riemann surface, which represents an infinite\nbranched cover of the spectral plane. We consider two examples of height\nmodels: the SOS model and the semi-restricted SOS (SRSOS) model, in which the\nheights are restricted from below. Both models are described in the continuum\nlimit by theories of 2D quantum gravity with conformal matter, perturbed by a\nthermal operator (1,3). We give a compact operator expression for the n-loop\namplitudes as a collection of target space Feynman rules. The n-point functions\nof local fields are obtained by shrinking the loops. In particular, we show\nthat the 4-point function of order operators in the SRSOS model coincides with\nthe 4-point function of the ``diagonal'' world sheet CFT studied in [1].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Sep 2006 14:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
