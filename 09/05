The tidal torques exerted by the disc can effectively drain orbital\nangular momentum from the binary. We have numerically calculated the\nevolutionary sequences of BHIMXBs, to examine the influence of the circumbinary\ndisc on the binary evolution. Our results indicate when $\\delta\\la 0.01-0.1$\n(depending on the initial orbital periods), the circumbinary disc can cause\nsecular orbital shrinking, leading to the formation of compact\n  BHLMXBs, otherwise the orbits always expand during the evolution. This\nscenario also suggests the possible existence of luminous, persistent BHLMXBs,\nbut it suffers the same problem as in Justham, Rappaport & Podsiadlowski (2006)\nthat, the predicted effective temperatures of the donor stars are significantly\nhigher than those of the observed donor stars in BHLMXBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2006 03:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The high energies of protostellar jets, implied by recent\nobservations of X-rays from such flows, came very much as a surprise. Inferred\nshock velocities are considerably higher than what was previously known, hence\nputting even larger energy demands on the driving sources of the jets. The\nstatistics of X-ray emitting jets are still poor, yet a few cases exist which\nseem to imply a correlation between the presence of HeI 1.0830 mu emission and\nX-ray radiation in a given source. Aims. This tentative correlation needs\nconfirmation and explanation. If the jet regions of HeI 1.0830 mu emission are\nclosely associated with those producing X-rays, high resolution infared\nspectroscopy can be used to observationally study the velocity fields in the\nhot plasma regions of the jets. This would provide the necessary evidence to\ntest and further develop theoretical models of intermediately fast (> 500 -\n1500 km/s) interstellar shock waves. Methods.

Such a shift changes the energy momentum\ntensor of matter by T^a_b --> T^a_b +\\rho \\delta^a_b. In the conventional\napproach, gravity breaks this symmetry and the gravitational field equations\nare not invariant under such a shift of the energy momentum tensor. I argue\nthat until this symmetry is restored, one cannot obtain a satisfactory solution\nto the cosmological constant problem. I describe an alternative perspective to\ngravity in which the gravitational field equations are [G_{ab} -\\kappa T_{ab}]\nn^an^b =0 for all null vectors n^a. This is obviously invariant under the\nchange T^a_b --> T^a_b +\\rho \\delta^a_b and restores the symmetry under\nshifting the matter lagrangian by a constant. These equations are equivalent to\nG_{ab} = \\kappa T_{ab} + Cg_{ab} where C is now an integration constant so that\nthe role of the cosmological constant is very different in this approach. The\ncosmological constant now arises as an integration constant, somewhat like the\nmass M in the Schwarzschild metric, the value of which can be chosen depending\non the physical context. These equations can be obtained from a variational\nprinciple which uses the null surfaces of spacetime as local Rindler horizons\nand can be given a thermodynamic interpretation. This approach turns out to be\nquite general and can encompass even the higher order corrections to Einstein's\ngravity and suggests a principle to determine the form of these corrections in\na systematic manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2006 12:51:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2006 10:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This book has three chapters. The first chapter is introductory in\nnature and makes the book a self-contained one. Chapter two introduces the\nconcept of fuzzy interval matrices. Also the notion of fuzzy interval matrices,\nneutrosophic interval matrices and fuzzy neutrosophic interval matrices, can\nfind applications to Markov chains and Leontief economic models. Chapter three\ngives the application of fuzzy interval matrices and neutrosophic interval\nmatrices to real-world problems by constructing the models already mentioned.\nFurther these models are mainly useful when the data is an unsupervised one and\nwhen one needs a multi-expert model.

Although classical bifurcations have been much\nstudied, border-collision bifurcations are not well understood. This paper\nconsiders a particular class of border-collision bifurcations, i.e.,\nborder-collision period-doubling bifurcations. We apply a subharmonic\nperturbation to the bifurcation parameter, which is also known as alternate\npacing, and we investigate the response under such pacing near the original\nbifurcation point. The resulting behavior is characterized quantitatively by a\ngain, which is the ratio of the response amplitude to the applied perturbation\namplitude. The gain in a border-collision period-doubling bifurcation has a\nqualitatively different dependence on parameters from that of a classical\nperiod-doubling bifurcation. Perhaps surprisingly, the differences are more\nreadily apparent if the gain is plotted vs. the perturbation amplitude (with\nthe bifurcation parameter fixed) than if plotted vs. the bifurcation parameter\n(with the perturbation amplitude fixed). When this observation is exploited,\nthe gain under alternate pacing provides a useful experimental tool to identify\na border-collision period-doubling bifurcation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2006 16:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2006 17:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
