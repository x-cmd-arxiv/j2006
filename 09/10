For the first time, simulations are carried out using an\nadaptive mesh that allows for a large dynamic range inside the star while still\nbeing efficient enough to follow the evolution of the jet long after it breaks\nout from the star. Our simulations allow us to single out three phases in the\njet evolution: a precursor phase in which relativistic material turbulently\nshed from the head of the jet first emerges from the star, a shocked jet phase\nwhere a fully shocked jet of material is emerging, and an unshocked jet phase\nwhere the jet consists of a free-streaming, unshocked core surrounded by a thin\nboundary layer of shocked jet material. The appearance of these phases will be\ndifferent to observers at different angles. The precursor has a wide opening\nangle and would be visible far off axis. The shocked phase has a relatively\nnarrow opening angle that is constant in time. During the unshocked jet phase\nthe opening angle increases logarithmically with time. As a consequence, some\nobservers see prolonged dead times of emission even for constant properties of\nthe jet injected in the stellar core. We also present an analytic model that is\nable to reproduce the overall properties of the jet and its evolution.

The reason why radial\nvelocity surveys were not able to detect these very-hot Jupiters (VHJ) is under\ndiscussion. A possible explanation is that these close-in planets are\nshort-lived, being evaporated on short time-scales due to UV flux of their host\nstars. In this case, stars hosting transiting VHJ planets would be\nsystematically younger than those in the radial velocity sample. We have used\nthe UVES spectrograph (VLT-UT2 telescope) to obtain high resolution spectra of\n5 faint stars hosting transiting planets, namely, OGLE-TR-10, 56, 111, 113 and\nTrES-1. Previously obtained CORALIE spectra of HD189733, and published data on\nthe other transiting planet-hosts were also used. The immediate objective is to\nestimate ages via Li abundances, using the Ca II activity-age relation, and\nfrom the analysis of the stellar rotational velocity. For the stars for which\nwe have spectra, Li abundances were computed as in Israelian et al. (2004)\nusing the stellar parameters derived in Santos et al. (2006). The chromospheric\nactivity index $S_{US}$ was built as the ratio of the flux within the core of\nthe Ca II H & K lines and the flux in two nearby continuum regions. The index\n$S_{US}$ was calibrated to Mount Wilson index $S_{MW}$ allowing the computation\nof the Ca II H & K corrected for the photospheric contribution. These values\nwere then used to derive the ages by means of the Henry et al. (1996)\nactivity-age relation. Bearing in mind the limitations of the ages derived by\nLi abundances, chromospheric activity, and stellar rotational velocities, none\nof the stars studied in this paper seem to be younger than 0.5 Gyr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Sep 2006 17:10:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
