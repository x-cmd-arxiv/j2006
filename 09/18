Contrary to what is\nexpected for a high-z metal-poor star, the neutral interstellar medium (ISM)\naround GRBs is not metal poor (metallicities vary from ~1/10 solar at z = 6.3\nto about solar at z = 2) and is enriched with dust (90-99% of iron is in solid\nform). If these metallicities are combined with those measured in the warm ISM\nof GRB host galaxies at z < 1, a redshift evolution is observed. Such an\nevolution predicts that the stellar masses of the hosts are in the range M* =\n10^(8.6-9.8) Msun. This prediction makes use of the mass-metallicity relation\n(and its redshift evolution) observed in normal star-forming galaxies.\nIndependent measurements coming from the optical-NIR photometry of GRB hosts\nindicate the same range of stellar masses, with a typical value similar to that\nof the Large Magellanic Cloud. This newly detected population of\nintermediate-mass galaxies is very hard to find at high redshift using\nconventional astronomy. However, it offers a compelling and relatively\ninexpensive opportunity to explore galaxy formation and cosmic chemical\nevolution beyond known borders, from the primordial universe to the present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2006 15:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

First, we define a resolution requirement based on\nthe wavelength for neutral stability of self gravitating waves in the disk. For\nparticle based or grid based simulations, this criterion takes the form,\nrespectively, of a minimum number of particles per critical (`Toomre') mass or\nmaximum value of a `Toomre number', $T= \\delta x/\\lambda_T$, where the\nwavelength, $\\lambda_T$, is the wavelength for neutral stability for waves in\ndisks. We apply our criterion to particle simulations and find that in order to\nprevent numerically induced fragmentation of the disk, the Toomre mass must be\nresolved by a minimum of six times the average number of neighbor particles\nused. Second, we require that particle based simulations with self gravity use\na variable gravitational softening.

In this letter, in order to clarify the significance of the\ncharacteristic distance, we study a Langevin model of a molecular motor with a\nhidden degree of freedom. We find that the ratio of the characteristic distance\nto the step size is equal to unity if the dominant paths in the state space are\none dimensional, while it deviates from unity if the dominant paths are\nbranched. Therefore, this parameter can be utilized to determine the\nreversibility of a motor even under a restricted observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2006 12:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2006 05:52:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Apr 2007 04:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Bohne verifies data structure operations and shows\nthat 1) the operations preserve data structure invariants and 2) the operations\nsatisfy their specifications expressed in terms of changes to the set of\nobjects stored in the data structure. During the analysis, Bohne infers loop\ninvariants in the form of disjunctions of universally quantified Boolean\ncombinations of formulas. To synthesize loop invariants of this form, Bohne\nuses a combination of decision procedures for Monadic Second-Order Logic over\ntrees, SMT-LIB decision procedures (currently CVC Lite), and an automated\nreasoner within the Isabelle interactive theorem prover. This architecture\nshows that synthesized loop invariants can serve as a useful communication\nmechanism between different decision procedures. Using Bohne, we have verified\noperations on data structures such as linked lists with iterators and back\npointers, trees with and without parent pointers, two-level skip lists, array\ndata structures, and sorted lists.
