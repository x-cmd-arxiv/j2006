We pursue a two line offensive: high resolution numerical\nsimulations are used to establish several new results, and an analytic model is\ndeveloped to understand their origins. Our simulations show: (i) that the z=0\ndark matter power spectrum is suppressed relative to linear theory by ~5% on\nscales (0.05<k[h/Mpc]<0.075); (ii) that, indeed, halo bias is non-linear over\nthe scales we probe and that the scale dependence is a strong function of halo\nmass. High mass haloes show no suppression of power on scales (k<0.07[h/Mpc]),\nand only show amplification on smaller scales, whereas low mass haloes show\nstrong, ~5-10%, suppression over the range (0.05 <k[h/Mpc] <0.15). Our results\nhave relevance for studies of the baryon acoustic oscillation features.\nNon-linear mode-mode coupling: (i) damps these features on progressively larger\nscales as halo mass increases; (ii) produces small shifts in the positions of\nthe peaks and troughs which depend on halo mass. Our analytic model is\ndescribed in the language of the `halo-model'. However, for the first time the\nhalo-halo clustering term is propagated into the non-linear regime using\n`1-loop' perturbation theory and a non-linear halo bias model. We show that,\nwith bias parameters derived from simulations, the model predictions are in\nagreement with the numerical results. We then use the model to explore the\nscale dependence of galaxies of different colour and find significant\ndifferences between the power spectra of the two populations.

The crucial factor is the\nrate at which energy can be radiated from the disk photosphere, which is\nrobustly limited from above in the convective case by the adiabatic temperature\ngradient (given a certain midplane temperature). Thus, although vigorous\nconvection is definitely possible in disks, the inefficiency of radiative loss\nfrom the photosphere may create a bottleneck limiting the ability of the disk\nto form self-gravitating objects. Based on this argument we derive a set of\nanalytical constraints which diagnose the susceptibility of an unstable disk to\nfragmentation and show that the formation of giant planets by fragmentation of\nprotoplanetary disks is unlikely to occur at distances of tens of AU.

A\ngrid of final compositions is explored including essentially all combinations\nof 56Ni, stable ``iron'', and intermediate mass elements that result in an\nunbound white dwarf.

In spite of software development being a planned activity, the\nanalysis of fluctuations reveals how external driving forces can be only\nobserved at weekly and higher time scales. Hourly and higher change frequencies\nmostly relate to internal maintenance activities. There is a crossover from\nendogenous to exogenous activity depending on the average number of file\nchanges. This new evidence suggests that software development is a\nnon-homogeneous design activity where stronger efforts focus in a few project\nfiles. The crossover can be explained with a Langevin equation associated to\nthe cascading process, where changes to any file trigger additional changes to\nits neighbours in the software network. In addition, analysis of fluctuations\nenables us to detect whether a software system can be decomposed in several\nsubsystems with different development dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Sep 2006 13:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2006 10:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
