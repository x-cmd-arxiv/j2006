Multi-wavelength broadband photometry was obtained to sample the\nnear and mid-IR spectral energy distributions to separate YSOs from field stars\nand classify the YSO evolutionary stage. ISOCAM mapping in the two filters LW2\n(5-8.5 um) and LW3 (12-18 um) of a 19' x 16' field was combined with JHKs data\nfrom 2MASS, Ks data from Arnica/NOT, and L' data from SIRCA/NOT.

In\nthis study, we have adopted a three-component (thin disk, thick disk and halo)\nmodel to analyze star counts information. By calculating the stellar space\ndensity as a function of distance from the Galactic plane, we determine that\nthe range of scale height for the thin disk varies from 220 to 320 pc. Although\n220 pc seems an extreme value, it is close to the lower limit in the\nliterature. The range of scale height for the thick disk is from 600 to 1100\npc, and the corresponding space number density normalization is 7.0-1.0% of the\nthin disk. We find that the scale height of the disk may be variable with\nobserved direction, which cannot simply be attributed to statistical errors.\nPossibly the main reasons can be attributed to the disk (mainly the thick disk)\nis flared, with a scale height increasing with radius. The structure is\nconsistent with merger origin for the thick disk formation.

The current-carrying,\nPoynting flux-dominated magnetic tower jet, which possesses a highly wound\nhelical magnetic field, is subject to the current-driven instability (CDI). We\nfind that, under general physical conditions including small perturbations in\nthe initial background profiles, the propagating magnetic tower jets develop\nthe non-axisymmetric, $m=1$ kink mode of the CDI. The kink mode grows on the\nlocal Alfv\\'en crossing time scale. In addition, two types of kink modes appear\nin the system. At the central region where external thermal pressure\nconfinement is strong, only the internal kink mode is excited and will grow. A\nlarge distance away from the central region where the external thermal pressure\nbecomes low, the external kink mode is observed. As a result, the exterior of\nmagnetic tower jets will be deformed into a large-scale wiggled structure. We\nalso discuss extensively the different physical processes that contribute to\nthe overall stability properties of the magnetic tower jets. Specifically, when\nthe jet propagates in an initially unperturbed background, we find that they\ncan survive the kink mode beyond the point predicted by the well-known\nKruskal-Shafranov (K-S) criterion. The stabilization in this case comes mainly\nfrom the dynamical relaxation of magnetic twists during the propagation of\nmagnetic towers; the magnetic pitch is reduced and the corresponding K-S\ncritical wavelength becomes longer as the tower jet proceeds. Furthermore, we\nshow that the pressure-driven and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities do not occur\nin the magnetic tower jets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2006 22:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We find a\nsignificant brightening (~ 1 mag) in the rest-frame 2800A characteristic\nmagnitude (M*) over the redshift range 0.3<z<1.7 and no evolution at higher\nredshifts.

The SFR derived from the 2800A luminosity density is almost\nfactor two higher than that derived from the 1500A luminosities.

This method is applied to\nthe Virgo cluster anemic galaxy NGC 4569. We extract radial profiles from\nrecently obtained UV GALEX images at 1530 and 2310 A, from visible and near-IR\nnarrow (Halpha) and broad band images at different wavelengths (u, B, g, V, r,\ni, z, J, H, K), from Spitzer IRAC and MIPS images and from atomic and molecular\ngas maps. The model in the absence of interaction (characterized by its\nrotation velocity and spin parameter) is constrained by the unperturbed H band\nlight profile and by the Halpha rotation curve. We can reconstruct the observed\ntotal-gas radial-density profile and the light surface-brightness profiles at\nall wavelengths in a ram-pressure stripping scenario by making simple\nassumptions about the gas removal process and the orbit of NGC 4569 inside the\ncluster. The observed profiles cannot be reproduced by simply stopping gas\ninfall, thus mimicing starvation. Gas removal is required, which is more\nefficient in the outer disk, inducing a radial quenching in the star formation\nactivity, as observed and reproduced by the model. This observational result,\nconsistent with theoretical predictions that a galaxy-cluster IGM interaction\nis able to modify structural disk parameters without gravitational\nperturbations, is discussed in the framework of the origin of lenticulars in\nclusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2006 10:14:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The individual components have\ngenerally a quasi-Gaussian shape; in particular they seldom show the\ndouble-horn profile that would be expected from the spatially resolved\noptically thin emission of a uniformly expanding shell.

The main goal of the present study is to determine the fractional SiO\nabundance in high-mass star-forming cores, and to investigate its dependence on\nthe physical conditions. In this way we wish to provide constraints on the\nchemistry models concerning the formation of SiO in the gas phase or via grain\nmantle evaporation. The work addresses also CH3CCH chemistry as the kinetic\ntemperature is determined using this molecule.\n  Methods. We estimate the physical conditions of 15 high-mass star-forming\ncores and derive the fractional SiO and CH3CCH abundances in them by using\nspectral line and dust continuum observations with the SEST.\n  Results. The kinetic temperatures as derived from CH3CCH range from 25 to 39\nK. The SiO emission regions are extended and typically half of the integrated\nline emission comes from the velocity range traced out by CH3CCH emission. The\nupper limit of SiO abundance in this 'quiescent' gas component is ~10^-10. The\naverage CH3CCH abundance is about 7 x 10^-9. It shows a shallow, positive\ncorrelation with the temperature, whereas SiO shows the opposite tendency.\n  Conclusions. We suggest that the high CH3CCH abundance and its possible\nincrease when the clouds get warmer is related to the intensified desorption of\nthe chemical precursors of the molecule from grain surfaces. In contrast, the\nobserved tendency of SiO does not support the idea that the evaporation of\nSi-containing species from the grain mantles would be important, and it\ncontradicts with the models where neutral reactions with activation barriers\ndominate the SiO production. A possible explanation for the decrease is that\nwarmer cores represent more evolved stages of core evolution with fewer\nhigh-velocity shocks and thus less efficient SiO replenishment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2006 12:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Derivatively-gauged fields are shown to have a\npurely algebraic action; they can be decoupled from the other fields through\ngauge-invariant re-definitions; a potential for the other fields is generated\nin the process; in the remaining action each gauge function eliminates one\nfield without residual gauge. The procedure applies to spherically symmetric\nand to cosmological backgrounds in either General Relativity or gauge theories.\nThe widely used ``gauge invariant perturbation theory'' is closely related. The\nsupplied general proof elucidates the algebraic mechanism behind it as well as\nthe method's domain of validity and its assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2006 11:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We treat both the scalar\nfield and gravity equivalently, considering each as a small quantum fluctuation\nabout a spatially independent background.
