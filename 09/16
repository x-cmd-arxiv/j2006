The CO J=3-2 observations show the presence of a very fast\n(~220 km/s), highly collimated, massive (0.03 Msun) bipolar outflow with a very\nlarge scalar momentum (about 10^{39} g cm s^{-1}), and the characteristic\nspatio-kinematic structure of bow-shocks at the tips of this outflow. The\nHalpha line shows an absorption feature blue-shifted from the systemic velocity\nby ~100 km/s, which most likely arises in neutral interface material between\nthe fast outflow and the dense walls of the bipolar lobes at low latitudes. The\nfast outflow in I22036, as in most PPNs, cannot be driven by radiation\npressure. We find an unresolved source of submillimeter (and millimeter-wave)\ncontinuum emission in I22036, implying a very substantial mass (0.02-0.04 Msun)\nof large (radius >~1 mm), cold (< ~50 K) dust grains associated with I22036's\ntoroidal waist. We also find that the 13C/12C ratio in I22036 is very high\n(0.16), close to the maximum value achieved in equilibrium CNO-nucleosynthesis\n(0.33). The combination of the high circumstellar mass (i.e., in the extended\ndust shell and the torus) and the high 13C/12C ratio in I22036 provides strong\nsupport for this object having evolved from a massive (>~4 Msun) progenitor in\nwhich hot-bottom-burning has occurred.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 22:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

As a function of its width, the conductance\nthrough a QPC changes in integer steps of G0 = $2e^2/h$, signalling the\nquantization of its tranverse modes.1,2 Such measurements also reveal an\nadditional shoulder at a value around 0.7, an observation which remains a\npuzzle even after more than a decade.

We\npresent results for a binary with polytropic index n=1, mass ratio\nM_{irr}^{BH}/M_{B}^{NS}=5 and neutron star compaction\nM_{ADM,0}^{NS}/R_0=0.0879, where M_{irr}^{BH} is the irreducible mass of the\nblack hole, M_{B}^{NS} the neutron star baryon rest-mass, and M_{ADM,0}^{NS}\nand R_0 the neutron star Arnowitt-Deser-Misner mass and areal radius in\nisolation, respectively. Our models represent valid solutions to Einstein's\nconstraint equations and may therefore be employed as initial data for\ndynamical simulations of black hole-neutron star binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 20:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

First, a space-time in which every causal curve can be\nextended into a closed causal curve is singularity free--a necessary property\nof a globally applicable physical theory. Second, a causality-violating\nspace-time exhibits a nontrivial topology--no closed timelike curve (CTC) can\nbe homotopic among CTCs to a point, or that point would not be causally well\nbehaved--and nontrivial topology has been explored as a model of particles.\nFinally, if every causal curve in a given space-time passes through an event\nhorizon, a property which can be called \"causal censorship\", then that\nspace-time with event horizons excised would still be causally well behaved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 16:09:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Sep 2006 15:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Jan 2007 04:18:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 4 Nov 2008 22:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 20 Mar 2010 22:23:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-23"}

Two methods of solution have\nbeen considered in the past: Lazarus and Leblond (1998) applied the \"special\"\nmethod by Bueckner (1987) and found the expression of the variation of the\nstress intensity factors for a wavy crack without solving the complete\nelasticity problem; their solution is expressed in terms of the physical\nvariables, and it involves five constants whose analytical representation was\nunknown; on the other hand the \"general\" solution to the problem has been\nrecently addressed by Bercial-Velez et al. (2005), using a Wiener-Hopf analysis\nand singular asymptotics near the crack front.\n  The main goal of the present paper is to complete the solution to the problem\nby providing the connection between the two methods. This is done by\nconstructing an integral representation for the Lazarus-Leblond's weight\nfunctions and by deriving the closed form representations of the\nLazarus-Leblond's constants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Sep 2006 11:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 May 2009 12:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In our simulations,\nSPs are excited at one end of a chain by a near-field tip. We then find\nnumerically the SP amplitude as a function of propagation distance. Two types\nof SPs are discovered. The first SP, which we call the ordinary or quasistatic,\nis mediated by short-range, near-field electromagnetic interaction in the\nchain. This excitation is strongly affected by Ohmic losses in the metal and by\ndisorder in the chain. These two effects result in spatial decay of the\nquasistatic SP by means of absorptive and radiative losses, respectively. The\nsecond SP is mediated by longer range, far-field interaction of nanospheres. We\nrefer to this SP as the extraordinary or non-quasistatic. The non-quasistatic\nSP can not be effectively excited by a near-field probe due to the small\nintegral weight of the associated spectral line. Because of that, at small\npropagation distances, this SP is dominated by the quasistatic SP. However, the\nnon-quasistatic SP is affected by Ohmic and radiative losses to a much smaller\nextent than the quasistatic one. Because of that, the non-quasistatic SP\nbecomes dominant sufficiently far from the exciting tip and can propagate with\nlittle further losses of energy to remarkable distances. The unique physical\nproperties of the non-quasistatic SP can be utilized in all-optical integrated\nphotonic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 16:46:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Unlike the case of normal conducting pipes, in which the\nmagnet quickly reaches the terminal velocity, inside a superconducting tube the\nmagnet falls freely. On the other hand, to enter the pipe the magnet must\novercome a large electromagnetic energy barrier. For sufficiently strong\nmagnets, the barrier is so large that the magnet will not be able to penetrate\nit and will be suspended over the front edge. We calculate the work that must\ndone to force the magnet to enter a superconducting tube. The calculations show\nthat superconducting pipes are very efficient at screening magnetic fields. For\nexample, the magnetic field of a dipole at the center of a short pipe of radius\n$a$ and length $L \\approx a$ decays, in the axial direction, with a\ncharacteristic length $\\xi \\approx 0.26 a$. The efficient screening of the\nmagnetic field might be useful for shielding highly sensitive superconducting\nquantum interference devices, SQUIDs. Finally, the motion of the magnet through\na superconducting pipe is compared and contrasted to the flow of ions through a\ntrans-membrane channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 17:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The differences are\nparticularly pronounced when the electromagnetic wavelength is comparable to\nthe primitive translation of the periodic structure. In such a case, the\nperiodic medium cannot be assigned any meaningful refractive index. Still, such\nfeatures as negative refraction and/or opposite phase and group velocities for\ncertain directions of light propagation can be found in almost any photonic\ncrystal. The only reservation is that unlike hypothetical uniform left-handed\nmedia, photonic crystals are essentially anisotropic at frequency range of\ninterest. Consider now a plane wave incident on a semi-infinite photonic\ncrystal. One can assume, for instance, that in the case of positive refraction,\nthe normal components of the group and the phase velocities of the transmitted\nBloch wave have the same sign, while in the case of negative refraction, those\ncomponents have opposite signs. What happens if the normal component of the\ntransmitted wave group velocity vanishes? Let us call it a \"zero-refraction\"\ncase. At first sight, zero normal component of the transmitted wave group\nvelocity implies total reflection of the incident wave. But we demonstrate that\ntotal reflection is not the only possibility. Instead, the transmitted wave can\nappear in the form of an abnormal grazing mode with huge amplitude and nearly\ntangential group velocity. This spectacular phenomenon is extremely sensitive\nto the frequency and direction of propagation of the incident plane wave. These\nfeatures can be very attractive in numerous applications, such as higher\nharmonic generation and wave mixing, light amplification and lasing, highly\nefficient superprizms, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Sep 2006 05:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
