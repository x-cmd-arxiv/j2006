Galaxies with blue outer regions have bulges and black\nholes that span a wide range in age and accretion rate. Galaxies with young\nbulges and strongly accreting black holes almost always have blue outer disks.\nOur suggested scenario is one in which the source of gas that builds the bulge\nand black hole is a low mass reservoir of cold gas in the disk.The presence of\nthis gas is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for bulge and black hole\ngrowth. Some mechanism must transport this gas inwards in a time variable way.\nAs the gas in the disk is converted into stars, the galaxies will turn red, but\nfurther gas infall can bring them back into the blue NUV-r sequence.(Abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 14:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Routing protocols based on a self-organized\nstructure have been studied principally for the robustness and the scalability\nthey provide. On the other hand, self-organization schemes may decrease the\nnetwork capacity since they concentrate the traffic on privileged links. This\npaper presents four models for evaluating the capacity of a routing schemes on\n802.11 like networks. Our approach consists in modeling the radio resource\nsharing principles of 802.11 like MAC protocols as a set of linear constraints.\nWe have implemented two models of fairness. The first one assumes that nodes\nhave a fair access to the channel, while the second one assumes that on the\nradio links. We then develop a pessimistic and an optimistic scenarii of\nspatial re-utilization of the medium, yielding a lower bound and an upper bound\non the network capacity for each fairness case. Our models are independent of\nthe routing protocols and provide therefore a relevant framework for their\ncomparison. We apply our models to a comparative analysis of the well-known\nshortest path base flat routing protocol OLSR against two main self-organized\nstructure approaches, VSR, and Wu & Li's protocols. This study concludes on the\nrelevance of self-organized approaches from the network capacity point of view.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 13:40:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

In many\nmodern data analysis problems, statisticians are faced with large datasets\nwhere the sample size, n, is of the same order of magnitude as the number of\nvariables p. Random matrix theory predicts that in this context, the\neigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix are not good estimators of the\neigenvalues of the population covariance.\n  We propose to use a fundamental result in random matrix theory, the\nMarcenko-Pastur equation, to better estimate the eigenvalues of large\ndimensional covariance matrices. The Marcenko-Pastur equation holds in very\nwide generality and under weak assumptions. The estimator we obtain can be\nthought of as \"shrinking\" in a non linear fashion the eigenvalues of the sample\ncovariance matrix to estimate the population eigenvalue. Inspired by ideas of\nrandom matrix theory, we also suggest a change of point of view when thinking\nabout estimation of high-dimensional vectors: we do not try to estimate\ndirectly the vectors but rather a probability measure that describes them. We\nthink this is a theoretically more fruitful way to think statistically about\nthese problems.\n  Our estimator gives fast and good or very good results in extended\nsimulations.

We point out that unlike for single particle quantum walk,\nupon measurement of its position after $N$ steps, the entangled particles are\nfound together with 1/2 probability and at different positions with 1/2\nprobability. This can act as an advantage in applications of the quantum walk.\nA special case is also treated using a complex physical system such as, inter\nspecies two-particle entangled Bose-Einstein condensate, as an example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 04:40:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2006 19:32:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2006 00:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2006 00:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Specifically, we study the\nimpact of ionization damping on the transition line shape, caused by the\npossibility of ionization of the 2S level by the same laser field. Using a\nMonte-Carlo simulation, we calculate the line shape of the \\sts transition for\nthe experimental geometry used in the two latest absolute frequency\nmeasurements (M. Niering {\\it et al.}, PRL 84, 5496 (2000) and M. Fischer {\\it\net al.}, PRL 92, 230802 (2004)). The calculated line shift and line width are\nin excellent agreement with the experimentally observed values. From this\ncomparison we can verify the values of the dynamic Stark shift coefficient for\nthe \\sts transition for the first time on a level of 15%. We show that the\nionization modifies the velocity distribution of the metastable atoms, the line\nshape of the \\sts transition, and has an influence on the derivation of its\nabsolute frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 08:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
