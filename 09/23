In the presence of radiative cooling, preheating affects the gas fraction\nthat can cool in two different ways. For small halos with masses <10^12Msun,\npreheating suppresses gas accretion, but most of the accreted gas can cool. For\nmore massive halos, preheating not only reduces the amount of accreted gas, but\nalso reduces the cooling efficiency. For both small and massive halos, gas\ncooling is delayed by preheating and in an inside-out fashion if the halo gas\nis assumed to be a single-phase medium. However, cooling can occur over a wider\nrange of redshifts and radii, if we assume a multi-phase medium. As examples,\ntwo specific preheating cases are investigated. In the first case, the\npreheating entropy is assumed to be proportional to the virial entropy of the\nhalo, as expected from AGN feedback. Such preheating effectively suppresses\nradiative cooling in halos with M>10^13Msun. We suggest that this may be the\nreason why the stellar mass function of galaxies breaks sharply at the massive\nend. Such preheating also helps create the hot diffused halos within which the\n\"radio mode\" feedback of AGNs can act effectively. In the second case, we\nassume the intergalactic medium is warm.

In the limit of large shoulder width to\ncore size, we argue that this phase diagram has a number of universal features,\nand classify the set of repulsive shoulders that lead to aggregation at high\ndensity. Surprisingly, the phase sequence and aggregate size adjusts so as to\nkeep almost constant inter-aggregate separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2006 17:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The electromagnetic plus exchange interactions\nwithin the subset of {\\it identical} particles are accounted for in a\nconsistent way, whereas {\\it different} particles can undergo only the\nelectromagnetic interactions. The origin of this different interaction\nmechanism for the subsets of identical and non-identical particles is traced\nback to the fundamental conservation laws for charge and energy-momentum: in\norder that these conservation laws can hold also for different particles, the\nstructure group $\\mathcal U(N)$ of the fibre bundles must be reduced to its\nmaximal Abelian subgroup $\\mathcal U(1) \\times \\mathcal U(1) \\times ... \\times\n\\mathcal U(1)$, which eliminates the exchange part of the bundle connection.\nThe persisting Abelian gauge symmetry adopts the meaning of the proper gauge\ngroup for the electromagnetic interactions which apply to the identical and\nnon-identical particles in the same way. Thus in RST there is an intrinsic\ndynamical foundation of the emergence of exchange effects for identical\nparticles, whereas the conventional theory is invaded by the exchange\nphenomenon via a purely kinematical postulate, namely the antisymmetrization\npostulate for the wave functions due to Pauli's exclusion principle. As a\nconcrete demonstration, a three-particle system is considered which consists of\na positively charged particle of arbitrary rest mass and of two negatively\ncharged particles of equal spin, mass and charge (e.g. electrons).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2006 13:06:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Previous numerical studies have found that prey evolution in response to\nchanging predation risk can have major quantitative and qualitative effects on\npredator-prey cycles, including: (i) large increases in cycle period, (ii)\nchanges in phase relations (so that predator and prey are cycling exactly out\nof phase, rather than the classical quarter-period phase lag), and (iii)\n\"cryptic\" cycles in which total prey density remains nearly constant while\npredator density and prey traits cycle. Here we focus on a chemostat model\nmotivated by our experimental system [Fussmann et al. 2000,Yoshida et al. 2003]\nwith algae (prey) and rotifers (predators), in which the prey exhibit rapid\nevolution in their level of defense against predation. We show that the effects\nof rapid prey evolution are robust and general, and furthermore that they occur\nin a specific but biologically relevant region of parameter space: when traits\nthat greatly reduce predation risk are relatively cheap (in terms of reductions\nin other fitness components), when there is coexistence between the two prey\ntypes and the predator, and when the interaction between predators and\nundefended prey alone would produce cycles. Because defense has been shown to\nbe inexpensive, even cost-free, in a number of systems [Andersson and Levin\n1999, Gagneux et al. 2006,Yoshida et al. 2004], our discoveries may well be\nreproduced in other model systems, and in nature. Finally, some of our key\nresults are extended to a general model in which functional forms for the\npredation rate and prey birth rate are not specified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2006 19:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-20"}

These quantum limits remain valid when the Hamiltonian is\naugmented by any parameter independent interaction among the systems and when\nadaptive measurements via parameter-independent coupling to ancillas are\nallowed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2006 20:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2006 20:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Currently, attenuated laser pulses are widely used and\nconsidered to be the most practical light source. For the receiver of photons,\nthreshold (or on/off) photon detectors are almost the only choice. Combining\nthe decoy-state idea and the security argument based on the uncertainty\nprinciple, we show that a QKD system composed of such practical devices can\nachieve the unconditional security without any significant penalty in the key\nrate and the distance limitation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Sep 2006 05:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
