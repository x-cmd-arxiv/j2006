We use high-resolution cosmological\nsimulations of high-redshift galaxies with and without energy feedback, as well\nas analytic modeling, to investigate whether the observed correlations can\narise without supernova-driven outflows. We find that the simulated dwarf\ngalaxies exhibit correlations similar to those observed as early as z~10,\nregardless of whether supernova feedback is included. We also show that the\ncorrelations can be well reproduced by our analytic model that accounts for\nrealistic gas inflow but assumes no outflows, and star formation rate obeying\nthe Kennicutt-Schmidt law with a critical density threshold. We argue that\ncorrelations in simulated galaxies arise due to the increasingly inefficient\nconversion of gas into stars in low-mass dwarf galaxies rather than\nsupernova-driven outflows. We also show that the decrease of the observed\neffective yield in low-mass objects, often used as an indicator of gas and\nmetal outflows, can be reasonably reproduced in our simulations without\noutflows. We show that this trend can arise if a significant fraction of metals\nin small galaxies is spread to the outer regions of the halo outside the\nstellar extent via mixing. In this case the effective yield can be\nsignificantly underestimated if only metals within the stellar radius are taken\ninto account.

We show that the recent\ncompilation of the Ne22(alpha,n)Mg25 rate leads to a remarkable reduction of\nthe efficiency of the s-process during core He-burning. In particular, this\nrate leads to the lowest overproduction factor of Kr80 found to date during\ncore He-burning in massive stars. The s-process yields resulting from shell\ncarbon burning turn out to be very sensitive to the structural evolution of the\ncarbon shell. This structure is influenced by the mass fraction of C12 attained\nat the end of core helium burning, which in turn is mainly determined by the\nC12(alpha,gamma)O16 reaction. The still present uncertainty in the rate for\nthis reaction implies that the s-process in massive stars is also subject to\nthis uncertainty. We identify some isotopes like Zn70 and Rb87 as the\nsignatures of the s-process during shell carbon burning in massive stars.

In our Z-track model, the soft apex is a quiescent\nstate of the source with lowest luminosity. Moving away from this point by\nascending the normal branch the strongly increasing luminosity of the Accretion\nDisc Corona (ADC) Comptonized emission L_ADC provides substantial evidence for\na large increase of mass accretion rate Mdot. There are major changes in the\nneutron star blackbody emission, kT increasing to high values, the blackbody\nradius R_BB decreasing, these changes continuing monotonically on both normal\nand horizontal branches. The blackbody flux increases by a factor of ten to\nthree times the Eddington flux so that the physics of the horizontal branch is\ndominated by the high radiation pressure of the neutron star, which we propose\ndisrupts the inner disc, and an increase of column density is detected. We\nfurther propose that the very strong radiation pressure is responsible for the\nlaunching of the jets detected in radio on the horizontal branch. On the\nflaring branch, we find that L_ADC is constant, suggesting no change in Mdot so\nthat flaring must consist of unstable nuclear burning. At the soft apex, the\nmass accretion rate per unit area on the neutron star m_dot is minimum for the\nhorizontal and normal branches and about equal to the theoretical upper limit\nfor unstable burning. Thus it is possible that unstable burning begins as soon\nas the source arrives at this position, the onset being consistent with theory.\nThe large increase in R_BB in flaring is reminiscent of radius expansion in\nX-ray bursts.

Similar to\nconventional POMDP problems, in this model the control action is based on all\npast measurements; however here this action is not for the control of state\nprocess, which is autonomous, but it is for influencing the measurement of that\nprocess. This POMDP is a controlled version of the hidden Markov process, and\nwe show that its optimal observability problem can be formulated as an average\ncost Markov decision process (MDP) scheduling problem. In this problem, a\npolicy is a rule for selecting sensors or adjusting the measuring device based\non the measurement history. Given a policy, we can evaluate the estimation\nentropy for the joint state-measurement processes which inversely measures the\nobservability of state process for that policy. Considering estimation entropy\nas the cost of a policy, we show that the problem of finding optimal policy is\nequivalent to an average cost MDP scheduling problem where the cost function is\nthe entropy function over the belief space.
