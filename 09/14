Using a Gaussian parametrization of the GCLF, we find a highly\nsignificant correlation between the GCLF dispersion, sigma, and the galaxy\nluminosity, M_B, in the sense that the GC systems in fainter galaxies have\nnarrower luminosity functions. The GCLF dispersions in the Milky Way and M31\nare fully consistent with this trend, implying that the correlation between\nsigma and galaxy luminosity is more fundamental than older suggestions that\nGCLF shape is a function of galaxy Hubble type. We show that the sigma - M_B\nrelation results from a bonafide narrowing of the distribution of (logarithmic)\ncluster masses in fainter galaxies.

In particular, we investigate the effect of\nre-scaling the self-interaction correction and we establish a link with the\nexisting atomic-like corrective scheme LDA+U. We find that when no re-scaling\nis applied, i.e. when we consider the entire atomic correction, the Kohn-Sham\nHOMO eigenvalue is a rather good approximation to the experimental ionization\npotential for molecules. Similarly the HOMO eigenvalues of negatively charged\nmolecules reproduce closely the molecular affinities. In contrast a re-scaling\nof about 50% is necessary to reproduce insulator bandgaps in solids, which\notherwise are largely overestimated.

For this reason, the conventional\nsinglet Higgs boson, the shifted field of spontaneous symmetry breaking, rather\nthan being a purely massive field, might possess a gapless branch describing\nthe long-wavelength fluctuations of the scalar condensate. To test this idea,\nthat might have substantial phenomenological implications, I compare with a\ndetailed lattice simulation of the broken phase in the 4D Ising limit of the\ntheory.

Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) is a\ncommonly accepted standard for mobility management of mobile users.

We analyze an\nevolutionary process, which we call pairwise comparison, for which we adopt the\nubiquitous Fermi distribution function from statistical mechanics. The inverse\ntemperature in this process controls the intensity of selection, leading to a\nunified framework for evolutionary dynamics at all intensities of selection,\nfrom random drift to imitation dynamics. We derive, for the first time, a\nsimple closed formula which determines the feasibility of cooperation in finite\npopulations, whenever cooperation is modeled in terms of any symmetric\ntwo-person game. In contrast with previous results, the present formula is\nvalid at all intensities of selection and for any initial condition. We\ninvestigate the evolutionary dynamics of cooperators in finite populations, and\nstudy the interplay between intensity of selection and the remnants of interior\nfixed points in infinite populations, as a function of a given initial number\nof cooperators, showing how this interplay strongly affects the approach to\nfixation of a given trait in finite populations, leading to counter-intuitive\nresults at different intensities of selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2006 22:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A particularly interesting example is\nevolutionary game theory, which is traditionally based on infinite populations,\nwhere strict Nash equilibria correspond to stable fixed points that are always\nevolutionarily stable. However, in finite populations stochastic effects can\ndrive the system away from strict Nash equilibria, which gives rise to a new\nconcept for evolutionary stability. The conventional and the new stability\nconcepts may apparently contradict each other leading to conflicting\npredictions in large yet finite populations. We show that the two concepts can\nbe derived from the frequency dependent Moran process in different limits.

Hence, it predicts the\nexistence of an intrinsic magnetic moment for the electron and gives its\ncorrect value. In the scale relativity framework, the Schrodinger, Klein-Gordon\nand Dirac equations have been derived from first principles as geodesics\nequations of a non-differentiable and continuous spacetime. Since such a\ngeneralized geometry implies the occurence of new discrete symmetry breakings,\nthis has led us to write Dirac bi-spinors in the form of bi-quaternions\n(complex quaternions). In the present work, we show that, in scale relativity\nalso, the correct Pauli equation can only be obtained from a non-relativistic\nlimit of the relativistic geodesics equation (which, after integration, becomes\nthe Dirac equation) and not from the non-relativistic formalism (that involves\nsymmetry breakings in a fractal 3-space). The same degeneracy procedure, when\nit is applied to the bi-quaternionic 4-velocity used to derive the Dirac\nequation, naturally yields a Pauli-type quaternionic 3-velocity. It therefore\ncorroborates the relevance of the scale relativity approach for the building\nfrom first principles of the quantum postulates and of the quantum tools. This\nalso reinforces the relativistic and fundamentally quantum nature of spin,\nwhich we attribute in scale relativity to the non-differentiability of the\nquantum spacetime geometry (and not only of the quantum space). We conclude by\nperforming numerical simulations of spinor geodesics, that allow one to gain a\nphysical geometric picture of the nature of spin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2006 09:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-13"}
