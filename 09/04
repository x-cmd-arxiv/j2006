By investigating the GC colour distribution as a\nfunction of distance from M87 and NGC 4552, another luminous Virgo elliptical\nin our survey field, it is found that clear bimodality ((V-I)_peak ~ 1.0 and\n1.2) is seen only in the inner regions (< 10 kpc) of the host galaxies and that\nit becomes weaker with radius due to the decreasing contribution of the red GC\n(V-I > 1.1) subpopulation.

Based on these\nfacts, we argue that the contribution of GCs associated with the Virgo cluster\n(e.g., intergalactic GCs) is not significant around M87 and is not the primary\nreason for the high S_N value of M87. Instead, most of the blue GCs around\nluminous ellipticals, as well as the red GCs, are presumed to be associated\nwith the host galaxy.

For the Fornax Cluster data, the offset from the TFR relates with the\nestimated age of the stars in the individual galaxies, in the sense and of the\nmagnitude expected if S0 galaxies had passively faded since being converted\nfrom spirals.

The correlation between color and M_z thus is a real\neffect. This conclusion is supported by biweight fits to the same color\ndistributions.

It represents each created fermion by an energy level that crosses\nthe zero-energy line from below. If several fermions of various masses are\ncreated, the level crossing picture contains several levels that cross the\nzero-energy line and cross each other. However, we know from quantum mechanics\nthat the corresponding levels cannot cross if the different fermions are mixed\nvia some interaction potential. The simultaneous application of these two\nrequirements on the level behavior leads to paradoxes.

First we treat the atomic\nanalog of the celebrated Hanbury Brown Twiss experiment, in which atom\ncorrelations result simply from interference effects without any atom\ninteractions.We have performed this experiment for both bosons and fermions.\nNext we show how atom interactions produce correlated atoms using the atomic\nanalog of spontaneous four-wavemixing. Finally, we briefly mention experiments\non a one dimensional gas on an atom chip in which correlation effects due to\nboth interference and interactions have been observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2006 14:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The separation of signals cannot be achieved perfectly,\nand we analyse the optimal decorrelation map in terms of added noise in the\nlocal separated states. Analytical results can be obtained both in the case of\ntwo-level quantum systems and for Gaussian states of harmonic oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2006 15:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
