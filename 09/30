The spectrum shows that the ISM of the GRB host galaxy at z = 3.967 is\ncomplex, with at least five components contributing to the main absorption\nsystem. We detect strong CII*, SiII*, OI* and FeII* fine structure absorption\nlines associated to the second and third component. For the first three\ncomponents we derive information on the relative distance from the site of the\nGRB explosion. Component 1, which has the highest redshift, does not present\nany fine structure nor low ionization lines; it only shows very high ionization\nfeatures, such as CIV and OVI, suggesting that this component is very close to\nthe GRB site. From the analysis of low and high ionization lines and fine\nstructure lines, we find evidences that the distance of component 2 from the\nsite of the GRB explosion is 10-100 times smaller than that of component 3. We\nevaluated the mean metallicity of the z=3.967 system obtaining values about\n0.01 of the solar metallicity or less. However, this should not be taken as\nrepresentative of the circumburst medium, since the main contribution to the\nhydrogen column density comes from the outer regions of the galaxy while that\nof the other elements presumably comes from the ISM closer to the GRB site.\nFurthermore, difficulties in evaluating dust depletion correction can modify\nsignificantly these values. The mean [C/Fe] ratio agrees well with that\nexpected by single star-formation event models. Interestingly the [C/Fe] of\ncomponent 2 is smaller than that of component 3, in agreement with GRB dust\ndestruction scenarios, if component 2 is closer than component 3 to the GRB\nsite.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2006 16:39:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 16:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-19"}

In analogy to processes in supernova\nremnants, these shock waves may generate a significant population of\nrelativistic electrons which, in turn, produce observable synchrotron emission.\nThe extended radio relics found at the periphery of several clusters and\npossibly also a fraction of radio halo emission may have this origin. Here we\nderive an analytic expression for (i) the total radio power in the downstream\nregion of a cosmological shock wave and (ii) the width of the radio-emitting\nregion. These expressions predict a spectral slope close to -1 for strong\nshocks. Moderate shocks, such as those produced in mergers between clusters of\ngalaxies, lead to a somewhat steeper spectrum. Moreover, we predict an upper\nlimit for the radio power of cosmological shocks. Comparing our results to the\nradio relics in Abell115, 2256, and 3667, we conclude that the magnetic field\nin these relics is typically at a level of 0.1 mu G.

The resulting emissions agree very well with the radio\npower-temperature relation found for cluster halos.

We show that such a\ntransition occurs due to the dual role of noise in regularizing the\nsemiclassical Wigner function and averaging over fine structures in classical\nphase space. The results are interpreted in the novel context of applying\nrecent advances in the theory of measurement and open systems to the\nsemiclassical quantum regime. We use these methods to show how a local\nsemiclassical picture is stabilized and can then be approximated by a classical\ndistribution at later times. The general results are demonstrated explicitly\nvia high-resolution numerical simulations of the quantum master equation for a\nchaotic Duffing oscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Sep 2006 15:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Apr 2007 19:37:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2007 16:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-18"}
