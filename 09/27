We explore this hypothesis through the analysis of high-spatial\nresolution, near-IR imaging data for a sample of 11 NLS1s. By employing the\ncorrelation between black-hole mass and host galaxy bulge luminosity, we\ndetermine the mean black-hole mass for our sample to be, in solar units, <(log\nM_BH)> = 7.9. Using the correlation between the size of the broad-line region\nand the monochromatic continuum luminosity, we obtain black-hole mass estimates\nunder the assumption that the emission-line gas is in virial equilibrium. The\nmean black-hole mass derived from this relation is <(log M_BH)> = 6.4. We\nexplore possible causes for this discrepancy and the ramifications for our\nunderstanding of the role played by NLS1s in AGN evolution. Because numerical\nsimulations constrain the start of the AGN duty cycle to a time shortly after a\nsignificant gravitational interaction, we examine the morphology and near-IR\nbulge colors of the NLS1 sample for evidence of recent encounters. The mean\nbulge color is found to be redder than that of both a matched sample of\nnon-active galaxies and published estimates for broad-line Seyferts.

In this case, the usual\nstability criterion for convective stability, the Schwarzschild criterion,\nwhich depends on entropy gradients, is modified. In the magnetized long mean\nfree path regime, instability occurs for small wavenumbers when (dP/dz)(dln\nT/dz) > 0, which we refer to as the Balbus criterion. We refer to the\nconvective-type instability that results as the magnetothermal instability\n(MTI). We use the equations of MHD with anisotropic electron heat conduction to\nnumerically simulate the linear growth and nonlinear saturation of the MTI in\nplane-parallel atmospheres that are unstable according to the Balbus criterion.\nThe linear growth rates measured from the simulations are in excellent\nagreement with the weak field dispersion relation. The addition of isotropic\nconduction, e.g. radiation, or strong magnetic fields can damp the growth of\nthe MTI and affect the nonlinear regime. The instability saturates when the\natmosphere becomes isothermal as the source of free energy is exhausted. By\nmaintaining a fixed temperature difference between the top and bottom\nboundaries of the simulation domain, sustained convective turbulence can be\ndriven. MTI-stable layers introduced by isotropic conduction are used to\nprevent the formation of unresolved, thermal boundary layers.

Maxted et al. (2000)\nconclude that the system mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. This conclusion,\nhowever, rests on the assumption that the sdB mass is 0.5 Mo. However, recent\nbinary population synthesis calculations suggest that the mass of an sdB star\nmay range from 0.3 Mo to more than 0.7 Mo. It is therefore important to measure\nthe mass of the sdB star simultaneously with that of the white dwarf. Since the\nrotation of the sdB star is tidally locked to the orbit the inclination of the\nsystem can be constrained if the sdB radius and the projected rotational\nvelocity can be measured with high precision. An analysis of the ellipsoidal\nvariations in the light curve allows to tighten the constraints derived from\nspectroscopy.

Here we present a\nbasic method to estimate these quantities. For the potential energy, we include\nthe modification of the gravity field by the tidal forces from the parent\nstars. This description allows a quick estimate of both the escape rate of the\natmospheric gas and the lifetime of a planet against the evaporation process.\nIn the energy diagram, we find an evaporation-forbidden region in which a\ngaseous planet would evaporate in less than 5 billion years. With their\nobserved characteristics, all extrasolar planets are found outside this\nevaporation-forbidden region. The escape rates are estimated to be in the range\n10^5 g/s to 10^{12} g/s, with few cases above 10^{11} g/s. The estimated escape\nrate for HD209458b is found to be consistent with the lower limit of 10^{10}\ng/s obtained from interpretation of the HI Lyman-alpha observations.\n  Finally, this diagram suggests possibilities for the nature of the recently\ndiscovered Neptune-mass planets. We find that GJ436b, 55Cnc_e and HD69830b\ncannot be low mass gaseous planets.

These\nmodels describe on a qualitative level the failure processes of real, brittle\nor quasi-brittle materials.

This allows us to develop new\ntime-splitting spectral (TSSP) methods for computing the dynamics of BEC in a\nrotational frame.The new numerical method is explicit, unconditionally stable,\nand of spectral accuracy in space and second order accuracy in time. Moreover,\nit is time reversible and time transverse invariant, and conserves the position\ndensity in the discretized level if the GPE does. Extensive numerical results\nare presented to confirm the above properties of the new numerical method for\nrotating BEC in 2D and 3D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2006 02:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This result, which parallels\na well-known relationship between the minimum Hamming weight of convolutional\ncodes and the minimum Hamming weight of their quasi-cyclic counterparts, is due\nto the fact that every pseudo-codeword in the convolutional code induces a\npseudo-codeword in the block code with pseudo-weight no larger than that of the\nconvolutional code's pseudo-codeword.

In this setting, the\nequilibrium distribution is the generalized escort distribution associated to\n$P\\_{1}$ and $Q$. The account of an additional constraint, an observable given\nby a statistical mean, leads to the maximization of R\\'{e}nyi/Tsallis\n$Q$-entropy subject to that constraint. Two natural scenarii for this\nobservation constraint are considered, and the classical and generalized\nconstraint of nonextensive statistics are recovered.

Thus we apply a Floquet decomposition of the equations of motion\nto solve the time-dependent problem beyond the multiphoton resonance condition.\nWe find that the various Floquet components can be interpreted in terms of\ndifferent scattering processes, and that the medium response oscillating in\nphase with the probe field in general is not phase-dependent. The phase\ndependence arises from a scattering of the coupling fields into the probe field\nmode at a frequency which in general differs from the probe field frequency.

As a result, a large number\nof quantum secure direct communication protocols based on dense coding is also\nable to be protected by this new type of one-party-QECC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2006 09:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 2007 02:08:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Two independent\nsetups, with cesium and rubidium atoms respectively, have shown that a high\npower and slightly diverging laser beam optimizes the transfer between the two\ntraps when its frequency is red-detuned from the atomic transition. This\npushing laser extracts a continuous beam of slow and cold atoms out of the\nfirst MOT and also provides a guiding to the second one through the dipolar\nforce. In order to optimize the transfer efficiency, the dependence of the\natomic flux on the pushing laser parameters (power, detuning, divergence and\nwaist) is investigated. The atomic flux is found to be proportional to the\nfirst MOT loading rate. Experimentally, the transfer efficiency reaches 70%,\ncorresponding to a transfer rate up to 2.7x10^8 atoms/s with a final velocity\nof 5.5 m/s. We present a simple analysis of the atomic motion inside the\npushing-guiding laser, in good agreement with the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2006 09:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Apr 2007 08:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
