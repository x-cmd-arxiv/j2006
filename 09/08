This is only the second GRB host to date,\nwhich is classified as an ERO. The spectral energy distribution is typical of a\ndusty starburst galaxy, with a redshift, z~1.9, a luminosity, L~5L*, and an\ninferred stellar mass of ~10^11-10^12 Msun, two orders of magnitude more\nmassive than typical GRB hosts. A comparison to the z~2 mass-metallicity (M-Z)\nrelation indicates that the host metallicity is about 0.5 Zsun. This result\nshows that at least some GRBs occur in massive, metal-enriched galaxies, and\nthat the proposed low metallicity bias of GRB progenitors is not as severe as\npreviously claimed. Instead we propose that the blue colors and sub-L*\nluminosities of most GRB hosts reflect their young starburst populations. This,\nalong with the locally increased fraction of starbursts at lower stellar mass,\nmay in fact be the underlying reason for the claimed low metallicity bias of\nz<0.2 GRB hosts. Consequently, GRBs and their host galaxies may serve as a\nreliable tracer of cosmic star formation, particularly at z>1 where the M-Z\nrelation is systematically lower, and the star formation rate is dominated by\nsub-L* galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2006 19:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

In very\nmassive (140-260 solar mass) stars, much of the pressure support comes from the\nradiation field, meaning that they are loosely bound, with an adiabatic\ncoefficient that is close to the minimum stable value. Near the end of C/O\nburning, the central temperature increases to the point that photons begin to\nbe converted into electron-positron pairs, softening gamma below this critical\nvalue. The result is a runaway collapse, followed by explosive burning that\ncompletely obliterates the star. While these explosions can be up to 100 times\nmore energetic that core collapse and Type Ia supernovae, their peak\nluminosities are only slightly greater. However, due both to copious Ni-56\nproduction and hydrogen recombination, they are brighter much longer, and\nremain observable for ~ 1 year. Since metal enrichment is a local process,\nPPSNe should occur in pockets of metal-free gas over a broad range of\nredshifts, greatly enhancing their detectability, and distributing their\nnucleosyntehtic products about the Milky Way. This means that measurements of\nthe abundances of metal-free stars should be thought of as directly\nconstraining these objects.

The mechanism proceeds via the oxidation\nof volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as methane (CH4) in the presence of\nUV radiation and nitrogen oxides (NOx). It would have been particularly\nfavoured during the Proterozoic given the high levels of CH4 (up to 1000 ppm)\nrecently suggested. Proterozoic UV levels on the surface of the Earth were\ngenerally higher compared with today, which would also have favoured the\nmechanism. On the other hand, Proterozoic O2 required in the final step of the\nsmog mechanism to form O3 was less abundant compared with present times.\nFurther, results are sensitive to Proterozoic NOx concentrations, which are\nchallenging to predict, since they depend on uncertain quantities such as NOx\nsource emissions and OH concentrations. We review NOx sources during the\nProterozoic and apply a photochemical box model having methane oxidation with\nNOx, HOx and Ox chemistry to estimate the O3 production from the smog\nmechanism.

The ISOCAM 5-16.5 micron CVF spectra were\nobtained as part of the ISOGAL infrared survey of the inner Galaxy. A\nclassification of the shape of the 10 micron dust feature was made for each\ncase. The spectra of the individual sources were modelled using a radiative\ntransfer model. Different combinations of amorphous silicates and\naluminium-oxide dust were used in the modelling. Spectra were obtained for 29\nsources of which 26 are likely to be Bulge AGB stars. Our modelling shows that\nthe stars suffer mass loss rates in the range of 10^{-8} - 5 x 10^{-7} Msun /\nyr, which is at the low end of the mass-loss rates experienced on the Thermally\nPulsing AGB. The luminosities range from 1,700 to 7,700 Lsun as expected for a\npopulation of AGB stars with Minit of 1.5 - 2Msun. In agreement with the\ncondensation sequence scenario, we find that the dust content is dominated by\nAl_2O_3 grains in this sample of low mass-loss rate stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2006 14:50:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2006 15:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In the sixties, Tait\ninvented a new method for showing cut elimination of natural deduction, based\non a predicate over the set of terms, such that the membership of an expression\nto the predicate implied the strong normalization property for that expression.\nThe predicate being defined by induction on types, or even as a fixpoint, this\nmethod could yield much larger ordinals. Later generalized by Girard under the\nname of reducibility or computability candidates, it showed very effective in\nproving the strong normalization property of typed lambda-calculi...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2006 07:48:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2007 13:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

This set is defined to be the set of\nall points in the plane through which the graph of some absolutely continuous\nL-minimizer passes with infinite derivative.\n  Motivated by Tonelli's partial regularity results, the question of the size\nof the universal singular set in measure naturally arises. Here we show that\nuniversal singular sets are characterized by being essentially purely\nunrectifiable -- that is, they intersect most Lipschitz curves in sets of zero\nlength and that any compact purely unrectifiable set is contained within the\nuniversal singular set of some smooth Lagrangian with given superlinear growth.\nThis gives examples of universal singular sets of Hausdorff dimension two,\nfilling the gap between previously known one-dimensional examples and Sychev's\nresult that universal singular sets are Lebesgue null.\n  We show that some smoothness of the Lagrangian is necessary for the\ntopological size estimate, and investigate the relationship between growth of\nthe Lagrangian and the existence of (pathological) rectifiable pieces in the\nuniversal singular set.\n  We also show that Tonelli's partial regularity result is stable in that the\nenergy of a `near' minimizer u over the set where it has large derivative is\ncontrolled by the how far u is from being a minimizer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2006 17:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
