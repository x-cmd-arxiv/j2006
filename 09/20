NGC 5315 showed itself as an odd object among the previously\nanalyzed central stars. Its temperature (~76kK) is considerably lower than\nother early-type [WR] stars (~120-150kK). From our models for NGC 5315 and NGC\n6905, it is unclear if early-type [WR] stars have smaller C/He mass ratios than\nother spectral classes, as claimed in the literature. A ratio of ~0.8 is found\nfor NGC 6905. We analyzed FUSE spectra of these stars for the first time, and\nidentified phosphorus in the spectra of BD+303639, NGC 40 and NGC 5315 through\nthe transitions P V 1118,1128.

A statistical analysis of the polar angle distribution of large\nsamples of QSOs from the SDSS survey and Monte Carlo simulations to calculate\ntheir significance are carried out.\n  RESULTS. There is a clear excess of QSOs near the minor axis with respect to\nthe major axis of nearby edge-on spiral galaxies, significant at a level\n3.5-sigma up to angular distances of 3 deg.

Gravitational lensing in the halo of nearby galaxies or\nextinction seem insufficient to explain the observed anisotropic distribution\nof QSOs. The anisotropic distribution agrees qualitatively with the predictions\nof Arp's models, which claim that QSOs are ejected by galaxies along the\nrotation axis, although Arp's prediction give a distance of the QSOs ~3 times\nsmaller than that found here.

Instead, the essential physics\ninvolves the luminosity dependence of the spectroscopic/color evolution of SNe\nIa. Following maximum-light, the SN colors are increasingly affected by the\ndevelopment of numerous Fe II/Co II lines which blanket the B-band and, at the\nsame time, increase the emissivity at longer wavelengths. Because dimmer SNe Ia\nare generally cooler, they experience an earlier onset of Fe III to Fe II\nrecombination in the iron-group rich layers of ejecta, resulting in a more\nrapid evolution of the SN colors to the red.

Under application of an\nelectric field larger than E_c, it changes dramatically as a result of the\nchanges in the microstructure: a significant yield stress is measured, and\nunder continuous shear the fluid is shear-thinning. The rheological properties,\nin particular the dynamic and static shear stress, were studied as a function\nof particle volume fraction, for various strengths(including null) of the\napplied electric field.

The\nplayers communicate and function in a way that resembles some real-life\nsituations. We consider two types of operations. First, there are operations\nthat follow an open democratic discussion. Second, some subgroups of players\nwho may have different interests make decisions based on their own group\ninterest. A key ingredient here is that the identity of each subgroup is known\nonly to the members of that group. In this paper, we are interested in the best\nstrategies for the different groups in such scenarios and in evaluating their\nrelative power. The main focus of the paper is the question: How large and\nstrong should a subgroup be in order to dominate the game? The concrete model\nstudied here is based on the popular game ``Mafia.'' In this game, there are\nthree groups of players: Mafia, detectives and ordinary citizens. Initially,\neach player is given only his/her own identity, except the mafia, who are given\nthe identities of all mafia members. At each ``open'' round, a vote is made to\ndetermine which player to eliminate. Additionally, there are collective\ndecisions made by the mafia where they decide to eliminate a citizen. Finally,\neach detective accumulates data on the mafia/citizen status of players. The\ncitizens win if they eliminate all mafia members. Otherwise, the mafia wins. We\nfirst find a randomized strategy that is optimal in the absence of detectives.\nThis leads to a stochastic asymptotic analysis where it is shown that the two\ngroups have comparable probabilities of winning exactly when the total\npopulation size is $R$ and the mafia size is of order $\\sqrt{R}$. We then show\nthat even a single detective changes the qualitative behavior of the game\ndramatically. Here, the mafia and citizens have comparable winning\nprobabilities only for a mafia size linear in $R$.

In this paper, we describe the\nApplication Hosting Environment (AHE) which we have developed to address some\nof these problems. The AHE is a lightweight, easily deployable environment\ndesigned to allow the scientist to quickly and easily run legacy applications\non distributed grid resources. It provides a higher level abstraction of a grid\nthan is offered by existing grid middleware schemes such as the Globus Toolkit.\nAs a result the computational scientist does not need to know the details of\nany particular underlying grid middleware and is isolated from any changes to\nit on the distributed resources. The functionality provided by the AHE is\n`application-centric': applications are exposed as web services with a\nwell-defined standards-compliant interface. This allows the computational\nscientist to start and manage application instances on a grid in a transparent\nmanner, thus greatly simplifying the user experience.
