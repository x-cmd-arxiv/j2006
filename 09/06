We determine the vertical structure of\nthe disc and its modes, treating radiative energy transport in the diffusion\napproximation. In the limit of very long radial wavelength, an analytical\ncriterion for viscous overstability is obtained, which involves the effective\nshear and bulk viscosity, the adiabatic exponent and the opacity law of the\ndisc. This differs from the prediction of a two-dimensional model. On shorter\nwavelengths (a few times the disc thickness), the criterion for overstability\nis more difficult to satisfy because of the different vertical structure of the\nmode. In a low-viscosity disc a third regime of intermediate wavelengths\nappears, in which the overstability is suppressed as the horizontal velocity\nperturbations develop significant vertical shear. We suggest that this effect\ndetermines the damping rate of eccentricity in protoplanetary discs, for which\nthe long-wavelength analysis is inapplicable and overstability is unlikely to\noccur on any scale. In thinner accretion discs and in decretion discs around Be\nstars overstability may occur only on the longest wavelengths, leading to the\npreferential excitation of global eccentric modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2006 14:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This facilitates an examination of\nvelocity anisotropy and non-Newtonian stress, and their effects on the viscous\nand viscous/gravitational instabilities thought to occur in Saturn's rings.\nBecause we adopt a dilute gas model, the applicability of our results to the\nactual dense rings of Saturn are significantly curtailled.

We find the Shu and Stewart formalism admits analytic\nstability criteria for the viscous overstability, viscous instability, and\nthermal instability. These criteria are compared with those of a hydrodynamic\nmodel incorporating the effective viscosity and cooling function computed from\nthe kinetic steady state. We find the two agree in the `hydrodynamic limit'\n(i.e. many collisions per orbit) but disagree when collisions are less\nfrequent, when we expect the viscous stress to be increasingly non-Newtonian\nand the velocity distribution increasingly anisotropic.

The response exhibits undamped\nlow frequency oscillations, whose amplitude has a clear resonance at the Rabi\nfrequency with the width being dependent on the damping rates of the TLS.

We devise bilayer LDPC\ncodes to approach the theoretically promised rate of the decode-and-forward\nrelaying strategy by incorporating relay-generated information bits in\nspecially designed bilayer graphical code structures. While conventional LDPC\ncodes are sensitively tuned to operate efficiently at a certain channel\nparameter, the proposed bilayer LDPC codes are capable of working at two\ndifferent channel parameters and two different rates: that at the relay and at\nthe destination. To analyze the performance of bilayer LDPC codes, bilayer\ndensity evolution is devised as an extension of the standard density evolution\nalgorithm. Based on bilayer density evolution, a design methodology is\ndeveloped for the bilayer codes in which the degree distribution is iteratively\nimproved using linear programming. Further, in order to approach the\ntheoretical decode-and-forward rate for a wide range of channel parameters,\nthis paper proposes two different forms bilayer codes, the bilayer-expurgated\nand bilayer-lengthened codes. It is demonstrated that a properly designed\nbilayer LDPC code can achieve an asymptotic infinite-length threshold within\n0.24 dB gap to the Shannon limits of two different channels simultaneously for\na wide range of channel parameters. By practical code construction,\nfinite-length bilayer codes are shown to be able to approach within a 0.6 dB\ngap to the theoretical decode-and-forward rate of the relay channel at a block\nlength of $10^5$ and a bit-error probability (BER) of $10^{-4}$. Finally, it is\ndemonstrated that a generalized version of the proposed bilayer code\nconstruction is applicable to relay networks with multiple relays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2006 19:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}

The evolution of the CC depends on the single\nparameter \\nu, which characterizes the running of the CC produced by the\nquantum effects of matter fields of the unknown high energy theory below the\nPlanck scale. The sign of \\nu indicates whether bosons or fermions dominate in\nthe running. The spectrum of perturbations is computed assuming an adiabatic\nregime and an isotropic stress tensor. Moreover, the perturbations of the CC\nterm are generated from the simplest covariant form suggested by the RG model\nunder consideration. The corresponding numerical analysis shows that for \\nu>0\nthere is a depletion of the matter power spectrum at low scales (large wave\nnumbers) as compared to the standard LCDM model, whereas for \\nu<0 there is an\nexcess of power at low scales.

It is based on the fact that\nblock-maxima of size m of the independent and identically distributed data\nscale at a rate of m^{1/alpha}. This scaling rate can be captured well by the\nmax-spectrum plot of the data that leads to regression based estimators.\nConsistency and asymptotic normality of these estimators is established under\nmild conditions on the behavior of the tail of the distribution. The results\nare obtained by establishing bounds on the rate of convergence of moment-type\nfunctionals of heavy-tailed maxima. Such bounds often yield exact rates of\nconvergence and are of independent interest. Practical issues on the automatic\nselection of tuning parameters for the estimators and corresponding confidence\nintervals are also addressed. Extensive numerical simulations show that the\nproposed method proves competitive for both small and large sample sizes and\nfor a large range of tail exponents. The method is shown to be more robust than\nthe classical Hill plot and is illustrated on two data sets of insurance claims\nand natural gas field sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2006 04:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

The model accounts for the laser openness to incoming pumping\npower and coming out energy with the emitted light. As an open system, a laser\nshould be in open equilibrium with thermodynamic forces, related to both energy\nflows. Conditions of equilibria are expressed by a logistic map with specially\ndeveloped dynamic inverse pitchfork bifurcation diagrams for graphical\npresentation of the solutions. The graphs explicitly confirm the triggering\nnature of a laser where bistability is manifested by pitchfork ground and laser\nbranches, with the relative population equilibrium values close to 1 and 0\ncorrespondingly. Simulation was run for a 2-level laser emitting light from far\ninfrared to short wave UV. A newly discovered feature of such a laser is the\nline spectrum of up and down transitions of the laser excitable dwellers,\noccurring between the laser and the ground pitchfork branches beyond\nbifurcation point. The density of the spectra lines tangibly increases as the\nbranches approach their limits. Transitions of both types are overlapping in\nopposite phases.
