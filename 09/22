This\nmethod produces ultra pure anti-neue (He-6) and neue (Ne-18) with a negligible\nnumu contamination (10-5). A novel kind of beta element production has been\nrecently proposed [15] in which slow (v about 0.1 c) fully ionized ions are\nstored in a very small storage ring.

This analysis shows\nthat the errors due to the hyperfine shift are dynamically supressed during\ngate operation, a fact we attribute to the AC Stark shift.

This work is concerned by the de\nBroglie-Bohm account of the properties of semiclassical systems. Semiclassical\nsystems are quantum systems that display the manifestation of classical\ntrajectories: the wavefunction and the observable properties of such systems\ndepend on the trajectories of the classical counterpart of the quantum system.\nFor example the quantum properties have a regular or disordered aspect\ndepending on whether the underlying classical system has regular or chaotic\ndynamics. In contrast, Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems have\nlittle in common with the trajectories of the classical counterpart, creating a\ndynamical mismatch relative to the quantum-classical correspondence visible in\nthese systems. Our aim is to describe this mismatch (explicit illustrations are\ngiven), explain its origin, and examine some of the consequences on the status\nof Bohmian trajectories in semiclassical systems. We argue in particular that\nsemiclassical systems put stronger constraints on the empirical acceptability\nand plausibility of Bohmian trajectories because the usual arguments given to\ndismiss the mismatch between the classical and the de Broglie-Bohm motions are\nweakened by the occurrence of classical trajectories in the quantum\nwavefunction of such systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2006 09:59:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Apr 2007 17:23:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-04"}
