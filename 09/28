Since the initial conditions are eventually forgotten by the evolving\nplanet, this approach is valid for mature planets, if not young ones. To\nexplore the evolution at young ages of jovian mass planets we have employed\nmodel planets created by one implementation of the core accretion mechanism as\ninitial conditions for evolutionary calculations. We find that young jovian\nplanets are smaller, cooler, and several to 100 times less luminous than\npredicted by earlier models. Furthermore the time interval during which the\nyoung jupiters are fainter than expected depends on the mass of planet. Jupiter\nmass planets (1 M_J) align with the conventional model luminosity in as little\nat 20 million years, but 10 M_J planets can take up to 1 billion years to match\ncommonly cited luminosities, given our implementation of the core accretion\nmechanism. If our assumptions, especially including our treatment of the\naccretion shock, are correct, then young jovian planets are substantially\nfainter at young ages than currently believed. These results have important\nconsequences both for detection strategies and for assigning masses to young\njovian planets based on observed luminosities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2006 19:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

From a detailed analysis of the system's geometry, and\nbased on additional circumstantial evidence from extant multi-wavelength\nobservations, we conclude that, while there may be grounds for the\ntidal-interaction assumption for this system, any interaction has thus far been\nof insufficient strength to trigger an enhanced level of recent star formation\nin the elliptical component, although close inspection of our colour images\nshows a faint excess of bluer pixels (a ~0.20 mag bluer \"loop\") in the\nelliptical galaxy on the side of the spiral companion. Given that there appears\nto be a moderate reservoir of available gas for ongoing star formation\n(although at low column density), this suggests that we are currently\nwitnessing the onset of the tidal interaction between NGC 4647 and NGC 4649. In\naddition, the triggering of new star formation in NGC 4649 may be significantly\nimpeded due to the much lower mass of the spiral component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2006 15:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The question as to whether the holonomy group\nnecessarily reduces in the presence of a specified number of independent\nparallel semi-Riemannian metrics is completely determined by the the signature\nof the metrics and the dimension, d, of the manifold, when d not equal to four.\nIn particular, the existence of two independent, parallel semi-Riemannian\nmetrics, one of which having signature (p,q) with p not equal to q, implies the\nholonomy group is reducible. The (p,p) cases, however, may allow for more than\none parallel metric and yet an irreducible holonomy group: for n=2m, m >2,\nthere exist connections on n-dimensional Euclidean space with irreducible\ninfinitesimal holonomy and which have two independent, parallel metrics of\nsignature (m,m).

This\nclassical-to-quantum mapping allows us to deal with standard optimization\nmethods, such as simulated and quantum annealing, on an equal basis.\nConsequently, we extend the quantum annealing method to simulate classical\nsystems at finite temperatures. Using the adiabatic theorem of quantum\nmechanics, we derive the rates to assure convergence to the optimal\nthermodynamic state. For simulated and quantum annealing, we obtain the\nasymptotic rates of $T(t) \\approx (p N) /(k_B \\log t)$ and $\\gamma(t) \\approx\n(Nt)^{-\\bar{c}/N}$, for the temperature and magnetic field, respectively. Other\nannealing strategies, as well as their potential speed-up, are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2006 22:07:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2006 17:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The knowledge of the\nimplications of the quantum theory to other theories, especially to the\nstatistical mechanics and the domain of validity has captivated scientists from\nthe beginning of quantum description. In such a context, the presence of an\nenvironment is commonly thought as entanglement, decohering and mixing\nproperties of quantum system. Generically, an environment is assumed to be a\nnoisy reservoir or a heat bath. Whereas in common interpretation of statistical\nmechanics the heat bath is unspecified, in quantum systems a heat bath can also\nprovide an indirect interaction between otherwise totally decoupled subsystems\nand consequently a means to entangle them \\cite{cdkl,dvclp,bfp}. In simple\nexample for the entanglement between two qubits due to the interaction with a\ncommon heat bath has been explicitly shown in \\cite{b}. Whereas in that paper\nthe bath is described by a collection of harmonic oscillators, it seems to be\nmore reasonable to specify the bath by stochastic forces represented by\nstochastic fields. From a more general point of view we expect the bath should\nbe better described in a stochastic manner and not by deterministic forces. In\nthe present paper we consider a two level system (qubits) which are able to\nperform flip processes by a coupling to classical stochastic fields. Thus we\nbridge the gap between quantum and classical probability theory. This problem\nis related to many other questions of quantum optics and quantum electronics\nwhere quantum statistical aspects arising from the intrinsic quantum character\nof the system while the possible time-dependence of system parameters may be\ninterpreted as the influence of classical thermal fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Sep 2006 11:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
