LRGs are luminous (L>3L*), galaxies which have been selected to\nhave photometric properties consistent with an old, passively evolving stellar\npopulation. For this study we utilise LRGs from the recently completed 2dF-SDSS\nLRG and QSO survey (2SLAQ). Equivalent widths of the Hdelta and [OII] lines are\nmeasured and used to define three spectral types, those with only strong Hdelta\nabsorption (k+a), those with strong [OII] in emission (em) and those with both\n(em+a). All other LRGs are considered to have passive star formation histories.\nThe vast majority of LRGs are found to be passive (~80 per cent), however\nsignificant numbers of k+a (2.7 per cent), em+a (1.2 per cent) and em LRGs (8.6\nper cent) are identified. An investigation into the redshift dependence of the\nfractions is also performed. A sample of SDSS MAIN galaxies with colours and\nluminosities consistent with the 2SLAQ LRGs is selected to provide a low\nredshift comparison. While the em and em+a fractions are consistent with the\nlow redshift SDSS sample, the fraction of k+a LRGs is found to increase\nsignificantly with redshift. This result is interpreted as an indication of an\nincreasing amount of recent star formation activity in LRGs with redshift. By\nconsidering the expected life time of the k+a phase, the number of LRGs which\nwill undergo a k+a phase can be estimated. A crude comparison of this estimate\nwith the predictions from semi-analytic models of galaxy formation shows that\nthe predicted level of k+a and em+a activity is not sufficient to reconcile the\npredicted mass growth for massive early-types in a hierarchical merging\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2006 01:42:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The optical extinction is small because the\ndust has sublimated at larger distances. The weakly absorbed soft component\ncannot originate from the same location. Because the stars drive strong jets,\nwe propose that the X-rays are generated in shocks in the jets.

The generalised second\nlaw guarantees the increase of the total entropy of the whole system which\nconsists of the black hole and the Hawking field. That is, the increase of the\nentropy of the Hawking field is faster than the decrease of the black hole\nentropy. In naive sense, one may expect that the entropy increase of the\nHawking field is due to the self-interaction among the composite particles of\nthe Hawking field, and that the \"self\"-relaxation of the Hawking field results\nin the entropy increase. Then, when one consider a non-self-interacting matter\nfield as the Hawking field, it is obvious that the self-relaxation does not\ntake place, and one may think that the total entropy does not increase.\nHowever, using nonequilibrium thermodynamics which has been developed recently,\nwe find for the non-self-interacting Hawking field that the rate of entropy\nincrease of the Hawking field (the entropy emission rate by the black hole)\ngrows faster than the rate of entropy decrease of the black hole along the\nblack hole evaporation in the empty space. The origin of the entropy increase\nof the Hawking field is the increase of the black hole temperature.

In the scenario, the SM Higgs mass\nbound constrains the mass of the heaviest CP-even Higgs H which has the SM like\ng_{ZZH} coupling. However, it is easier to make the heaviest Higgs heavy by the\neffect of off-diagonal elements of the mass matrix of the CP-even Higgs because\nthe larger eigenvalue of 2 times 2 matrix becomes larger by introducing\noff-diagonal elements. Thus, the smaller stop masses can be consistent with the\nLEP constraints.

It is partially\nasymmetric in the sense that the probability of hopping left is q times the\nprobability of hopping right. Additionally, particles may enter from the left\nwith probability alpha and exit from the right with probability beta.\n  It has been observed that the (unique) stationary distribution of the PASEP\nhas remarkable connections to combinatorics -- see for example the papers of\nDerrida, Duchi and Schaeffer, and Corteel. Most recently we proved that in fact\nthe (normalized) probability of being in a particular state of the PASEP can be\nviewed as a certain weight generating function for permutation tableaux of a\nfixed shape. (This result implies the previous combinatorial results.) However,\nour proof relied on the matrix ansatz of Derrida et al, and hence did not give\nan intuitive explanation of why one should expect the steady state distribution\nof the PASEP to involve such nice combinatorics.\n  In this paper we define a Markov chain -- which we call the PT chain -- on\nthe set of permutation tableaux which projects to the PASEP in a very strong\nsense. This gives a new proof of our previous result which bypasses the matrix\nansatz altogether. Furthermore, via the bijection from permutation tableaux to\npermutations, the PT chain can also be viewed as a Markov chain on the\nsymmetric group. Another nice feature of the PT chain is that it possesses a\ncertain symmetry which extends the \"particle-hole symmetry\" of the PASEP.

This practice can generate grossly incorrect\nanswers that can be self-perpetuating: polishing the Ferraris rather than the\nJeeps ``causes'' them to continue to win more races than the Jeeps\n$\\Leftrightarrow$ visiting the high-prescribing doctors rather than the\nlow-prescribing doctors ``causes'' them to continue to write more\nprescriptions. This presentation will take ``causality'' seriously, not just as\na casual concept implying some predictive association in a data set, and will\nillustrate why propensity score methods are generally superior in practice to\nthe standard predictive approaches for estimating causal effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2006 10:48:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

We\ndemonstrate the validity of this approach by numerically computing eigenvalue\nspectra of lagged correlation matrices based on uncorrelated, Gaussian\ndistributed time-series. We then compare our theoretical findings with\neigenvalue densities obtained from actual high frequency (5 min) data of the\nS&P500 and discuss the observed deviations. We identify various non-trivial,\nnon-random patterns and find asymmetric dependencies associated with\neigenvalues departing strongly from the Gaussian prediction in the imaginary\npart. For the same time-series, with the market contribution removed, we\nobserve strong clustering of stocks, i.e. causal sectors. We finally comment on\nthe time-stability of the observed patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2006 15:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}
