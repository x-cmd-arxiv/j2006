Some studies have required compact dark matter halos (constant\nM/L ratio) in order to reconcile gravitational lenses with the HST/WMAP value\nof the Hubble constant (72 +/- 8 km/s /Mpc and 72 +/- 5 km/s /Mpc,\nrespectively). This is in direct contradiction with X-ray, stellar dynamical,\nand weak lensing studies, which all point towards extended halos and isothermal\ndensity profiles. In this work, we examine an up-to-date sample of 13 lensing\ngalaxies resulting in a data set consisting of 21 time delays. We select\nsystems in which there is a single primary lensing galaxy (e.g. excluding\nsystems undergoing mergers).

This yields a value of n = 2.11+/-0.12\n(3sigma) for the mean profile when modeling with a prior on the Hubble\nconstant, which is only consistent with isothermality within 3 sigma. Note that\nthis is a formal error from our calculations, and does not include the impact\nof sample selection or simplifications in the lens modeling.

The cluster lifetime until fragmentation due to the\nloss of a C2 dimer has been calculated as a function of temperature. The\nactivation energy and the frequency factor in the Arrhenius equation for the\nfragmentation rate have been found to be Ea = (9.2 +- 0.4) eV and A = (8 +-\n1)10^{19} 1/s. It is shown that fragmentation can occur after the C60 cluster\nloses its spherical shape. This fact must be taken into account in theoretical\ncalculations of Ea.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2006 07:19:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Weak field perturbation theory is developed to\nshow that noise in the amplitude and frequency components of the control field\ncan enhance the process of population transfer in a multilevel ladder system.\nThe analytical results in this paper support the point that under suitable\nconditions an optimal field can cooperate with noise to improve the control\noutcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Sep 2006 18:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
