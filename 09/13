Current instruments employing the\ncombination of adaptive optics (AO) and coronagraphy can typically detect\nobjects within 2'' of the star that are 10^{4-5} times fainter. Correlated\nspeckle noise is one of the biggest obstacles limiting such high-contrast\nimaging. We have obtained a series of 284 8 s, AO-corrected, coronagraphically\nocculted H-band images of the star Vega at the 3.63 m AEOS telescope located on\nHaleakala, Hawaii. This dataset is unique for studying the temporal behavior of\nspeckle noise, and represents the first time such a study on highly corrected\n_coronagraphic_ AO images has been carried out in a quantitative way. We find\nthe speckle pattern to be highly stable in both position and time in our data.\nThis is due to the fact that the AO system corrects disturbances to the stellar\nwave front at the level where the instrumental wave front errors dominate.\nBecause of this, we find that our detection limit is not significantly improved\nsimply with increased exposure time alone. However, we are able to improve our\ndynamic range by 1.5-2 magnitudes through subtraction of static/quasi-static\nspeckles in two rotating frames: the telescope pupil frame and the deformable\nmirror frame. Furthermore, from our data, we are able to constrain the mass of\nany purported companion to Vega to be less than 45 M_J at 8 AU and less than 30\nM_J at 16 AU, radii not previously probed at these sensitivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2006 20:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Such an evaluation depends on the geometry of\nthe BLR. There are two major options for the BLR configuration: spherically\nsymmetric or ``flattened''. In the latter case the inclination to the line of\nsight becomes a relevant parameter. This paper is devoted to evaluate the bias\non the estimate of the Eddington ratio when a spherical geometry is assumed\n(more generally when inclination effects are ignored), while the actual\nconfiguration is ``flattened'', as some evidence suggests. This is done as a\nfunction of luminosity and redshift, on the basis of recent results which show\nthe existence of a correlation between the fraction of obscured AGN and these\ntwo parameters up to at least z=2.5. The assumed BLR velocity field is akin to\nthe ``generalized thick disk'' proposed by Collin et al. (2006). Assuming an\nisotropic orientation in the sky, the mean value of the bias is calculated as a\nfunction of luminosity and redshift. It is demonstrated that, on average, the\nEddington ratio obtained assuming a spherical geometry is underestimated for\nhigh luminosities, and overestimated for low luminosities. This bias converges\nfor all luminosities at z about 2.7, while nothing can be said on this bias at\nlarger redshifts due to the lack of data. The effects of the bias, averaged\nover the luminosity function of broad line AGN, have been calculated. The\nresults imply that the bias associated with the a-sphericity of the BLR make\neven worse the discrepancy between the observations and the predictions of\nevolutionary models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2006 14:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In\nfact, recent interest in underwater acoustic ad hoc and sensor networks hints\nat the need to understand how to design networks in 3D. Unfortunately, the\ndesign of 3D networks is surprisingly more difficult than the design of 2D\nnetworks. For example, proofs of Kelvin's conjecture and Kepler's conjecture\nrequired centuries of research to achieve breakthroughs, whereas their 2D\ncounterparts are trivial to solve.

Our results indicate that the use of the\nVoronoi tessellation of 3D space to create truncated octahedral cells results\nin the best strategy.

Second, using nonlinear\nsimulations, it is shown that the presence of fast growing high-m modes leads\nto a rapid turbulent collapse in an annular region, whereby small magnetic\nisland structures form.

Free energy profiles for a single methane\nmolecule in droplets, ranging in diameter D, from 1 to 4 nm, show that the\ndroplet surfaces are strongly favorable as compared to the interior. From the\ntemperature dependence of the free energy in D=3 nm, we show that this effect\nis entropically driven. The potentials of mean force (PMFs) between two methane\nmolecules show that the solvent separated minimum in the bulk is completely\nabsent in confined water, independent of the droplet size since the solute\nparticles are primarily associated with the droplet surface. The tendency of\nmethanes with charges (Mq+ and Mq- with q+ = q- = 0.4e, where e is the\nelectronic charge) to be pinned at the surface depends dramatically on the size\nof the water droplet. When D=4 nm, the ions prefer the interior whereas for D<4\nnm the ions are localized at the surface, but with much less tendency than for\nmethanes. Increasing the ion charge to e makes the surface strongly\nunfavorable. Reflecting the charge asymmetry of the water molecule, negative\nions have a stronger preference for the surface compared to positive ions of\nthe same charge magnitude. With increasing droplet size, the PMFs between Mq+\nand Mq- show decreasing influence of the boundary due to the reduced tendency\nfor surface solvation. We also show that as the solute charge density decreases\nthe surface becomes less unfavorable.

It is desirable to select horizontally transferred genes reliably\nand examine their relationship to operons. We here developed a method to\nidentify candidates of horizontally transferred genes based on minimization of\ngene cluster insertions/deletions. To select a benchmark set of positively\nhorizontally transferred genes against which the candidate set can be\nappraised, we devised another procedure using intergenetic alignments.\nComparison with the benchmark set of horizontally transferred genes\ndemonstrated the absence of a significant number of false positives in the\ncandidates, showing that the method identifies horizontally transferred genes\nwith a high degree of confidence. Horizontally transferred genes constitute at\nleast 5.5% of the genes in Escherichia, Shigella, and Salmonella and ~46% of\nwhich originate from other gamma-proteobacteria. Not only informational genes,\nbut also operational genes (those involved in housekeeping) are horizontally\ntransferred less frequently than expected. A gene-cluster analysis of\nEscherichia coli K-12 operons revealed that horizontal transfer produced four\nentire operons and expanded two operons, but deletion of intervening genes\naccounts for the formation of no operons. We propose that operons generally\nform by horizontal gene transfer. We further suggest that genes with related\nessential functions tend to reside in conserved operons, while genes in\nnonconserved operons generally confer slight advantage to the organisms and\nfrequently undergo horizontal transfer and decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2006 07:25:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
