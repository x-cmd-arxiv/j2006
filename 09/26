We propose a new statistical\napproach to examine the dependence of time delays on the complexity of lens\npotentials, such as higher-order perturbations, non-isothermality, and\nsubstructures. Specifically, we introduce a reduced time delay and explore its\nbehavior as a function of the image configuration that is characterized by the\nasymmetry and opening angle of the image pair. In particular we derive a\nrealistic conditional probability distribution. We find that the probability\ndistribution is sensitive to the image configuration such that more asymmetric\nand/or smaller opening angle image pairs are more easily affected by\nperturbations on the primary lens potential. On average time delays of double\nlenses are less scattered than those of quadruple lenses. Furthermore, the\nrealistic conditional distribution allows a new statistical method to constrain\nthe Hubble constant. We find that 16 published time delay quasars constrain the\nHubble constant to be H_0=70+/-6 km/s/Mpc, where the value and its error are\nestimated using jackknife resampling. After including rough estimates of the\nsizes of important systematic errors, we find H_0=68+/-6(stat.)+/-8(syst.)\nkm/s/Mpc.

In the present application, the mixing matrix is\nparameterized in terms of the spectral indices of Galactic synchrotron and\nthermal dust emissions, while the free-free spectral index is prescribed by\nbasic physics, and is thus assumed to be known. We consider simulated\nobservations of the microwave sky with angular resolution and white stationary\nnoise at the nominal levels for the PLANCK satellite, and realistic foreground\nemissions, with a position dependent synchrotron spectral index.

The concentration of intense free-free emission on the Galactic\nplane introduces a steep dependence of the spectral index of the global\nGalactic emission with Galactic latitude, close to the Galactic equator. This\nfeature makes difficult for the CCA to recover the synchrotron spectral index\nin this region, given the limited angular resolution of PLANCK, especially at\nlow frequencies. A cut of a narrow strip around the Galactic equator (|b|<3\ndeg), however, allows us to overcome this problem.

In particular,\nthermodynamically stable multidomain states exist in the spin-flop region,\nowing to the phase coexistence at this first-order transition. For this region,\nequilibrium spin-configurations and parameters of the multidomain states are\nderived as functions of the external magnetic field. The components of the\nmagnetic susceptibility tensor are calculated for homogeneous and multidomain\nstates in the vicinity of the spin-flop. The remarkable anomalies in these\nmeasurable quantities provide an efficient method to investigate magnetic\nstates and to determine materials parameters in bulk and confined\nantiferromagnets, as well as in nanoscale synthetic antiferromagnets. The\nmethod is demonstrated for experimental data on the magnetic properties near\nthe spin-flop region in the orthorhombic layered antiferromagnet\n(C_2H_5NH_3)_2CuCl_4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2006 14:10:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Sep 2006 15:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

Several unexpected and counter--intuitive behaviors emerge from our\nanalysis: the amount of CP violation in one of the decay channels can prove to\nbe be irrelevant to the final lepton asymmetry, leading to successful\nleptogenesis even in scenarios with a vanishing CP violation in the leptonic\nsector; gauge annihilations can be the dominant effect in the determination of\nthe evolution of the triplet density up to very high values of its mass,\nleading anyway to a sizeable final lepton asymmetry, which is also a growing\nfunction of the wash--out parameter K=Gamma_d/H, defined as usual as the ratio\nbetween the triplet decay amplitude Gamma_d and the Hubble constant H; on the\nother hand, cancellations in the Boltzmann equations may lead to a vanishing\nlepton asymmetry if in one of the decay channels both the branching ratio and\nthe amount of CP violation are suppressed, but not vanishing.

We consider in detail a\nfundamental conceptual issue in the higher-dimensional theory: Since the cross\nproduct is only physically meaningful in three spatial dimensions, how do\ntraditional vector formulas involving the cross product or curl operation\ngeneralize in the case of universal extra dimensions? For example, is angular\nmomentum physically meaningful, and, if so, how is it related to the position\nand momentum vectors? We find that if angular velocity, torque, angular\nmomentum, and magnetic field, for example, are regarded as anti-symmetric\nsecond-rank tensors instead of pseudovectors, we can construct tensor forms of\nthe standard cross product and curl equations that do generalize to higher\ndimensions. Although Maxwell's equations have been generalized to extra\ndimensions in terms of differential forms, we show that our simple technique\ncasts the generalized Maxwell's equations in a form very similar to the\nstandard vector calculus. We also provide direct integrals for the fields in a\npractical tensor calculus form. We explore the electric and magnetic fields in\ndetail to show that there are no fundamental conceptual problems hidden in the\ntheory - e.g. how the Lorentz force can be meaningfully expressed in terms of\nthe velocity and magnetic field when the traditional cross product and\nright-hand rule do not apply.

In the case of two dimensions the model is analytically\nsolvable, leading to a genuine continuum theory of quantum gravity whose ground\nstate describes a two-dimensional \"universe\" completely governed by quantum\nfluctuations. One observes that two-dimensional Lorentzian and Euclidean\nquantum gravity are distinct. In the second part of the review we address the\nquestion of how to incorporate a sum over space-time topologies in the\ngravitational path integral. It is shown that, provided suitable causality\nrestrictions are imposed on the path integral histories, there exists a\nwell-defined nonperturbative gravitational path integral including an explicit\nsum over topologies in the setting of CDT. A complete analytical solution of\nthe quantum continuum dynamics is obtained uniquely by means of a double\nscaling limit. We show that in the continuum limit there is a finite density of\ninfinitesimal wormholes. Remarkably, the presence of wormholes leads to a\ndecrease in the effective cosmological constant, reminiscent of the suppression\nmechanism considered by Coleman and others in the context of a Euclidean path\nintegral formulation of four-dimensional quantum gravity in the continuum. In\nthe last part of the review universality and certain generalizations of the\noriginal model are discussed, providing additional evidence that CDT define a\ngenuine continuum theory of two-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2006 22:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Call a group G parafree of rank n if it shares the lower\ncentral sequence with a free group of rank n, and if it is residually\nnilpotent. The deviation of a fg parafree group is the difference between the\nminimum possible number of generators of G and the rank of G. So parafree\ngroups of deviation zero are actually just free groups.

In this paper\nalgebraic geometric invariants involving the number of maximal irreducible\ncomponents (mirc) of R(G) and the dimension of R(G) for certain classes of\none-relator parafree groups are computed.

Quantum theory allows for\nvarious coarse-grained descriptions some of which are mutually incompatible.\nFor most purposes, however, we are interested in the small subset of\n``quasiclassical descriptions'' defined by ranges of values of averages over\nsmall volumes of densities of conserved quantities such as energy and momentum\nand approximately conserved quantities such as baryon number. The\nnear-conservation of these quasiclassical quantities results in approximate\ndecoherence, predictability, and local equilibrium, leading to closed sets of\nequations of motion. In any description, information is sacrificed through the\ncoarse graining that yields decoherence and gives rise to probabilities for\nhistories. In quasiclassical descriptions, further information is sacrificed in\nexhibiting the emergent regularities summarized by classical equations of\nmotion.
