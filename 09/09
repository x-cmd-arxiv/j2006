We present a possible explanation for the formation and\nconfinement of such rings in optically thin circumstellar disks, without\ninvoking shepherding planets. If an enhancement of dust grains (e.g., due to a\ncatastrophic collision) occurs somewhere in the disk, photoelectric emission\nfrom the grains can heat the gas to temperatures well above that of the dust.\nThe gas orbits with super(sub)-Keplerian speeds inward (outward) of the\nassociated pressure maximum. This tends to concentrate the grains into a narrow\nregion. The rise in dust density leads to further heating and a stronger\nconcentration of grains. A narrow dust ring forms as a result of this\ninstability. We show that this mechanism not only operates around early-type\nstars that have high UV fluxes, but also around stars with spectral types as\nlate as K. This implies that this process is generic and may have occurred\nduring the lifetime of each circumstellar disk.

The present work addresses these three issues while\ntaking into account permanent and transient marks left in the visited nodes.\nDifferent topologies are considered for trail reconstruction and trail source\nidentification, including four complex networks models and four real networks,\nnamely the Internet, the US airlines network, an email network and the\nscientific collaboration network of complex network researchers. Our results\nshow that the topology of the network influence in trail reconstruction, source\nidentification and agent dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Sep 2006 01:09:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Aug 2007 13:27:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Our\nstudy of quantum nonlocality complements those carried out by Volovich and\nKhrennikov. They pointed to an unphysical character of nonlocality in Bell's\ntheorem whose context does not contain the very structure of the space-time.\nHowever, there is another reason leading to nonlocality in QM. The existing\nmodel of a 1D completed scattering evidences that QM, as it stands, even with a\nproper space-time context, contradicts special relativity. By our model this\nscattering process represents an entanglement of two coherently evolved\nalternative sub-processes, transmission and reflection; whose characteristics\nare measured well after the scattering event. Quantum nonlocality appears in\nthis problem due to the inconsistency of the superposition principle with the\ncorpuscular properties of a particle. It can take part only in one of the\nsub-processes. However the superposition principle allows introducing\nobservables common for them. In the fresh wording, this principle must forbid\nintroducing observables for entangled states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Sep 2006 06:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Next, we discuss the suitability of the\nconsidered tripartite entangled states to the implementation of quantum\ninformation and communication protocols with continuous variables. This will\nlead to a feasible experimental proposal to test the promiscuous sharing of\ncontinuous-variable tripartite entanglement, in terms of the optimal fidelity\nof teleportation networks with Gaussian resources.
