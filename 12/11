In\njust over half of the sources we find that these spectra and other properties\nare consistent with the standard model of powerful Type IIn supernovae\ninteracting with their pre-explosion stellar wind. The rate of appearance of\nnew radio sources identified with these supernova events suggests that an\nunusually large fraction of core collapse supernovae in Arp 220 are highly\nluminous; possibly implying a radically different stellar initial mass function\nor stellar evolution compared to galactic disks. Another possible explanation\ninvokes very short (~3 x 10^5 year) intense (~10^3 M_Sol year^-1) star\nformation episodes with a duty cycle of ~10%.

But when they are common, many beneficial mutations will occur before\nany can fix, so there will be many different mutant lineages in the population\nconcurrently. In an asexual population, these different mutant lineages\ninterfere and not all can fix simultaneously. In addition, further beneficial\nmutations can accumulate in mutant lineages while these are still a minority of\nthe population. In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of such multiple\nmutations and the interplay between multiple mutations and interference between\nclones. These result in substantial variation in fitness accumulating within a\nsingle asexual population. The amount of variation is determined by a balance\nbetween selection, which destroys variation, and beneficial mutations, which\ncreate more. The behavior depends in a subtle way on the population parameters:\nthe population size, the beneficial mutation rate, and the distribution of the\nfitness increments of the potential beneficial mutations. The\nmutation-selection balance leads to a continually evolving population with a\nsteady-state fitness variation. This variation increases logarithmically with\nboth population size and mutation rate and sets the rate at which the\npopulation accumulates beneficial mutations, which thus also grows only\nlogarithmically with population size and mutation rate. These results imply\nthat mutator phenotypes are less effective in larger asexual populations. They\nalso have consequences for the advantages (or disadvantages) of sex via the\nFisher-Muller effect; these are discussed briefly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2006 00:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
