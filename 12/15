We consider an alternative\nhypothesis that most are wind driven bubbles (WDBs) associated with very young\nsuper star clusters (SSCs). In this scenario, the synchrotron emitting\nparticles are produced at the site of the shock transition between the cluster\nwind and the hot bubble gas. The particles radiate in the strong magnetic field\nproduced in the expanding shell of shocked ambient interstellar gas. One of the\nmotivations for this hypothesis is the lack of observed time variability in\nmost of the sources, implying ages greater than expected for SNRs, but\ncomfortably within the range for WDBs. In addition, as SNRs, these sources are\nnot effective in driving the starburst mass outflow associated with the nuclear\nregion of M82, thus requiring a separate mechanism for coupling SN energy to\nthis outflow. The WDB hypothesis is found to be feasible for underlying\nclusters in the mass range ~2x10^(4+/-1)Msun, and ambient gas densities in the\nrange ~3x10^(3+/-1)cm^-3. The ages of the bubbles are between several x10^3 and\nseveral x10^4 years.

We present the results of our ongoing\nspectroscopic observations of gravitationally lensed quasars in order to\nmeasure the redshift of their lensing galaxies. We report on the determination\nof the lens redshift in seven gravitationally lensed systems.\n  Methods: Our deep VLT/FORS1 spectra are spatially deconvolved in order to\nseparate the spectrum of the lensing galaxies from the glare of the much\nbrighter quasar images. Our observing strategy involves observations in\nMulti-Object-Spectroscopy (MOS) mode which allows the simultaneous observation\nof the target and of several crucial PSF and flux calibration stars.

Two series of experiments were performed. The first uses a\ntraditional film photographic camera, and the picture is later treated on a\ncomputer in order to count the fragments and classify them according to their\nsizes. The second uses a modern digital camera. The first approach has the\nadvantage of a better resolution for small fragment sizes.

The drop is modelled by a\nconnected cluster of Ising spins pointing up (mercury) surrounded by Ising\nspins pointing down (air). The Ising coupling which tends to keep the spins\nsegregated represents the surface tension. Initially the cluster carries an\nextra energy equally shared among all its spins, corresponding to the coherent\nkinetic energy due to the fall. Each spin which touches the floor loses its\nextra energy transformed into a thermal, incoherent energy represented by a\ntemperature used then to follow the dynamics through Monte Carlo simulations.\nWhenever a small piece becomes disconnected from the big cluster, it is\nconsidered a fragment, and counted.

The\napproximations tested include the moderate density approximation of the\ngeneralized Boltzmann-Enskog memory function (MGBE) of Mazenko and Yip, the\nbinary collision approximation (BCA) and the short time approximation (STA) of\nRanganathan and Andersen, and various other approximations derived by us using\ndiagrammatic methods. The tests are of twotypes. The first is a comparison of\nthe correlation functions predicted by each approximate memory function with\nthe simulation results, especially for the self longitudinal current\ncorrelation function (SLCC). The second is a direct comparison of each\napproximate memory function with a memory function numerically extracted from\nthe correlation function data. The MGBE memory function is accurate at short\ntimes but decays to zero too slowly and gives a poor description of the\ncorrelation function at intermediate times. The BCA is exact at zero time, but\nit predicts a correlation function that diverges at long times. The STA gives a\nreasonable description of the SLCC but does not predict the correct temperature\ndependence of the negative dip in the function that is associated with caging\nat low temperatures. None of the other binary collision approximations is a\nsystematic improvement upon the STA. The extracted memory functions have a\nrapidly decaying short time part, much like the STA, and a much smaller, more\nslowly decaying part of the type predicted by mode coupling theory. Theories\nthat use mode coupling commonly include a binary collision term in the memory\nfunction but do not discuss in detail the nature of that term. ...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2006 00:15:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 May 2007 19:01:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Introducing Immirzi parameter makes it possible to\nrestore the link between these two symmetries and thus removes the ambiguity,\nbut at the cost of making classical perturbation theory rather intractable.\nThen we argue that the two main sources of complexity of perturbation theory,\ninfinite number of degrees of freedom and non-trivial curvature of the phase\nspace of General Relativity could be disentangled when studying {\\it quantum}\namplitudes.

The result depends not only on the size of this domain (i.e.,\non the cutoff values), but also on its orientation determined by the position\nof the light-front plane. Explicitly covariant formulation of light front\ndynamics allows us to parameterize the latter dependence in a very transparent\nform. If we decompose the regularized amplitude in terms of independent\ninvariant amplitudes, extra (non-physical) terms should appear, with spin\nstructures which explicitly depend on the orientation of the light front plane.\nThe number of form factors, i.e., the coefficients of this decomposition,\ntherefore also increases. The spin-1/2 fermion self-energy is determined by\nthree scalar functions, instead of the two standard ones, while for the elastic\nelectromagnetic vertex the number of form factors increases from two to five.\nIn the present paper we calculate perturbatively all these form factors in the\nYukawa model.

As a consequence for unitary representations, we\ncharacterize those groups in the latter classes for which the first cohomology\nwith respect to the left regular representation on $L^2(G)$ is non-zero; and we\ncharacterize uniform lattices in those groups for which the first $L^2$-Betti\nnumber is non-zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2006 16:32:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-08-04"}

We show that median filtering and linear filtering have\nsimilar asymptotic worst-case mean-squared error (MSE) when the signal-to-noise\nratio (SNR) is of order 1, which corresponds to the case of constant per-pixel\nnoise level in a digital signal. To see dramatic benefits of median smoothing\nin an asymptotic setting, the per-pixel noise level should tend to zero (i.e.,\nSNR should grow very large). We show that a two-stage median filtering using\ntwo very different window widths can dramatically outperform traditional linear\nand median filtering in settings where the underlying object has edges. In this\ntwo-stage procedure, the first pass, at a fine scale, aims at increasing the\nSNR. The second pass, at a coarser scale, correctly exploits the nonlinearity\nof the median. Image processing methods based on nonlinear partial differential\nequations (PDEs) are often said to improve on linear filtering in the presence\nof edges. Such methods seem difficult to analyze rigorously in a\ndecision-theoretic framework. A popular example is mean curvature motion (MCM),\nwhich is formally a kind of iterated median filtering. Our results on iterated\nmedian filtering suggest that some PDE-based methods are candidates to\nrigorously outperform linear filtering in an asymptotic framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2006 22:25:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2009 08:18:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

This solver uses exact analytic\nexpression for computing the influence of singularity distributions instead of\nadopting the conventional and convenient approximation of nodal concentration\nof charges. Due to the exact foundation expressions, the solver has been found\nto be exceptionally accurate in the complete physical domain, including the\nnear field. In this work, we explore the possibility of using the neBEM solver\nto solve 3D electrostatic problems related to comb drives. In particular, we\ninvestigate the relationship between the accuracy achieved and the\ncomputational expenses incurred for a realistic comb drive geometry. In the\nprocess, we estimate the charge density distribution, potential distribution\nand the capacitance of the comb structure. The study has led us to the\nconclusion that the neBEM solver can yield very accurate estimates of all the\nproperties of interest at a reasonable computational expenditure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2006 12:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
