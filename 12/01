We found\nin both cases highly significant spectral variability below ~ 6 keV down to the\nshortest time-scales investigated. These variations can be naturally explained\nin terms of variations in the low energy cut-off due to obscuring matter along\nthe line of sight. If the cut-off is modeled by two neutral absorption\ncomponents, one fully covering the source and the second covering only a\nfraction of the source, the shortest time-scale of variability of a few days\nconstrains the location of the obscuring matter to within 3.4 X 10^4\nSchwarzschild radii from the central X-ray source. This is consistent with the\ndistance of the Broad Emission Line Region, as inferred from reverberation\nmapping, and difficult to reconcile with the parsec scale dusty molecular torus\nof Krolik & Begelman (1988). We have also explored a more complex absorption\nstructure, namely the presence of an ionized absorber. Although the behaviour\nof the ionization parameter is nicely consistent with the expectations, the\nresults are not completely satisfactory from the statistical point of view.\n  The overall absorption during the 2001 December observation is lower than in\nall other historical observations with similar 2-10 keV flux. This suggests\nthat absorption variability plays a crucial role in the observed flux\nvariability of this source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2006 15:53:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2007 10:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The strong coupling regime between the atom and\ncavity-confined photon corresponds to the reversible exchange of energy between\nthe two modes, and underpins a wide range of CQED phenomena with applications\nin quantum information science, including for example as quantum logic gates\nand as sources of entangled states. An important advance was achieved recently\nwhen strong coupling between excitons and cavity photons was reported for the\nfirst time for localized quantum dots (QDs) in micron-size solid state\ncavities. This has significance in terms of scalability and integration with\nother optical devices, and could lead to the emergence of \"quantum optics on a\nchip\" technology. However the results presented so far for quantum dots are in\nthe linear regime, corresponding to coupling to the vacuum field (vacuum Rabi\nsplitting); they are not a true QED effect and can equally well be described by\nclassical physics as the coupling between two oscillators. In this paper, we\npresent evidence for a purely quantum phenomenon for the QD/cavity photon\nsystem, namely the increase in splitting of the levels when the mean number of\nphotons in the cavity is increased.

However, this correlation has never been well\njustified. In this paper, we study the same issue by applying the weighted\nPageRank algorithm to the connectivity graph or space-space topology for\nranking the individual spaces, and find surprisingly that (1) the PageRank\nscores are better correlated to human movement rates than the space syntax\nmetrics, and (2) the underlying space-space topology demonstrates small world\nand scale free properties. The findings provide a novel justification as to why\nspace syntax, or topological analysis in general, can be used to predict human\nmovement. We further conjecture that this kind of analysis is no more than\npredicting a drunkard's walking on a small world and scale free network.\n  Keywords: Space syntax, topological analysis of networks, small world, scale\nfree, human movement, and PageRank\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2006 11:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2007 08:00:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Feb 2008 14:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 18 Feb 2008 15:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}
