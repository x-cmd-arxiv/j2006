Correcting\nfor detection incompleteness, the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of each\ngalaxy is consistent with a powerlaw with negative logarithmic differential\nslope, beta~2.0. However, beta strongly correlates with incompleteness,\nindicating the XLF flattens at low-Lx. The composite XLF is well-fitted by a\npowerlaw with a break at 2.21(+0.65,-0.56)E38 erg/s and beta=1.40(+0.10,-0.13)\nand 2.84(+0.39,-0.30) below and above it, respectively. The break is close to\nthe Eddington limit for a 1.4Msun neutron-star, but the XLF shape rules out its\nrepresenting the division between neutron-star and black-hole systems. Although\nthe XLFs are similar, we find evidence of some variation between galaxies. The\nhigh-Lx XLF slope does not correlate with age, but may correlate with\n[alpha/Fe]. Considering only LMXBs with Lx>1E37 erg/s, matching the LMXBs with\nglobular clusters (GCs) identified in HST observations of 19 of the galaxies,\nwe find the probability a GC hosts an LMXB is proportional to LGC^alpha\nZFe^gamma} where alpha=1.01+/-0.19 and gamma=0.33+/-0.11. Correcting for GC\nluminosity and colour effects, and detection incompleteness, we find no\nevidence that the fraction of LMXBs with Lx>1e37 erg/s in GCs (40%), or the\nfraction of GCs hosting LMXBs (~6.5%) varies between galaxies. The spatial\ndistribution of LMXBs resembles that of GCs, and the specific frequency of\nLMXBs is proportional to the GC specific luminosity, consistent with the\nhypothesis that all LMXBs form in GCs. If the LMXB lifetime is tau and the duty\ncycle is Fd, our results imply ~1.5 (tau/1E8 yr)^-1 /Fd LMXBs are formed per\nGyr per GC and we place an upper limit of 1 active LMXB in the field per\n3.4E9Lsun of V-band luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2006 03:03:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jul 2008 21:04:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

This idea is in full accord with\nrelativistic quantum theory. In particular, it resembles the ``dressed\nparticle'' approach to quantum electrodynamics. Although the complete\nnon-perturbative of this theory is yet unknown, one can reasonably guess its\nform in low perturbation orders and in the (1/c)^2 approximation. We suggest a\nrelativistic energy operator, which in the classical limit reduces to the\nEinstein-Infeld-Hoffmann Hamiltonian for massive particles and correctly\ndescribes the effects of gravity on photons, including the light bending, the\nShapiro delay, the gravitational time dilation and the red shift. The causality\nof this approach is briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 Dec 2006 00:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Wed, 2 Apr 2008 17:55:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2007 18:26:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 2007 21:07:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2007 22:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 1 Mar 2007 04:26:58 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 20 Aug 2007 20:22:30 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Wed, 5 Sep 2007 00:20:16 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Sat, 5 Jan 2008 02:18:35 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Fri, 8 Feb 2008 00:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-02"}
