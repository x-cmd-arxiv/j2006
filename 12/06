An analysis of extensive Monte Carlo data in equilibrium shows\nthat the probability distribution of l as a function of N obeys a scaling of\nthe form p(l,N) ~ l^(-c) f(l/N^D), with c ~ 1.25 and D ~ 1. Both D and c could\nbe independent of knot type. As a consequence, the knot is weakly localized,\ni.e. <l> ~ N^t, with t=2-c ~ 0.75.

In the scaling ~ N^(nu) (nu ~0.58) of the radius of gyration of the\nwhole ring, this length determines a leading power law correction which is much\nstronger than that found in the case of unrestricted topology. The existence of\nsuch correction is confirmed by an analysis of extensive Monte Carlo data for\nthe radius of gyration.

In this regime knot length determinations\ncan be based on the entropic competition between two knotted loops separated by\na slip link.
