We conclude that the slow release of the heat deposited in the\ndeep crust during a magnetar burst naturally accounts for the spectral changes\nduring the afterglow.

The distance of the early-type stars in Westerlund2 is\nestablished to be in excellent agreement with the distance of WR20a, indicating\nthat WR20a actually belongs to the cluster. Our best estimate of the cluster\ndistance thus amounts to 8.0pm1.4kpc. Despite the earlier spectral types, the\ncurrently known population of early-type stars in Westerlund2 does not provide\nenough ionizing photons to account for the radio emission of the RCW49 complex.\nThis suggests that there might still exist a number of embedded early O-stars\nin RCW49.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2006 09:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

AIMS:\nWe test the quality of a non-linear force-free coronal magnetic field\nextrapolation code with the help of a known analytical solution. METHODS: The\nnon-linear force-free equations are numerically solved with the help of an\noptimization principle. The method minimizes an integral over the force-free\nand solenoidal condition. As boundary condition we use either the magnetic\nfield components on all six sides of the computational box in Case I or only on\nthe bottom boundary in Case II. We check the quality of the reconstruction by\ncomputing how well force-freeness and divergence-freeness are fulfilled and by\ncomparing the numerical solution with the analytical solution. The comparison\nis done with magnetic field line plots and several quantitative measures, like\nthe vector correlation, Cauchy Schwarz, normalized vector error, mean vector\nerror and magnetic energy. RESULTS: For Case I the reconstructed magnetic field\nshows good agreement with the original magnetic field topology, whereas in Case\nII there are considerable deviations from the exact solution. This is\ncorroborated by the quantitative measures, which are significantly better for\nCase I. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the strong nonlinearity of the considered\nforce-free equilibrium, the optimization method of extrapolation is able to\nreconstruct it; however, the quality of reconstruction depends significantly on\nthe consistency of the input data, which is given only if the known solution is\nprovided also at the lateral and top boundaries, and on the presence or absence\nof flux concentrations near the boundaries of the magnetogram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2006 15:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Energetically, the CIB is very important as it\ncontains as much energy as the extragalactic optical background. The nature and\nevolutionary status of the objects making up the background are, however,\nunclear. The CIB peaks at ~150 microns, and as such is most effectively studied\nfrom space. The limited apertures of space-borne telescopes set the angular\nresolution that can be attained, and so even Herschel, with its 3.5m diameter,\nwill be confusion-limited at this wavelengths at ~5mJy. The bulk of the\ngalaxies contributing to the CIB are fainter than this, so it is difficult to\nstudy them without interferometry. Here we present the results of a preliminary\nstudy of an alternative way of probing fainter than the continuum confusion\nlimit using far-IR imaging spectroscopy. An instrument capable of such\nobservations is being planned for SPICA - a proposed Japanese mission with an\naperture equivalent to that of Herschel and more than 2 orders of magnitude\nmore sensitive.

It is shown that the\nresulting gravity-spin-2 theory is given by a Chern-Simons action of an affine\nalgebra. The global symmetry is determined, which contains an affine extension\nof the Ehlers group. We show that the broken phase can in turn be constructed\nvia gauging a certain subgroup of the global symmetry group. Finally,\ndeformations of the Kaluza-Klein theory on AdS_3 x S*3 x S*3 and the\ncorresponding symmetry breakings are analyzed as possible applications for the\nAdS/CFT correspondence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2006 13:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This generalizes the\npreviously studied case of SU(3) backgrounds in that the left- and right-moving\nsector each have a different globally defined spinor. Given a truncation to a\nfinite number of modes, these backgrounds lead to a conventional\nfour-dimensional low-energy effective theory. The results are manifestly mirror\nsymmetric and give terms corresponding to the mirror dual couplings of\nCalabi-Yau compactifications with magnetic fluxes.

Such situations lead to some very subtle statistical problems. In\nparticular, Ingster and Donoho and Jin have considered a sparse normal means\ntesting problem, in which they described the precise demarcation or detection\nboundary. Meinshausen and Rice have shown that it is even possible to estimate\nconsistently the fraction of nonzero coordinates on a subset of the detectable\nregion, but leave unanswered the question of exactly in which parts of the\ndetectable region consistent estimation is possible. In the present paper we\ndevelop a new approach for estimating the fraction of nonzero means for\nproblems where the nonzero means are moderately large. We show that the\ndetection region described by Ingster and Donoho and Jin turns out to be the\nregion where it is possible to consistently estimate the expected fraction of\nnonzero coordinates.

Disorder is introduced by having\nthe interaction vary from one monomer to another, as a constant $u$ plus i.i.d.\nmean-0 randomness. There is a critical value of $u$ above which the polymer is\npinned, placing a positive fraction (called the contact fraction) of its\nmonomers at 0 with high probability. When the excursions of the underlying\nchain have a finite mean but no finite exponential moment, it is known that the\ndepinning transition (more precisely, the contact fraction) in the\ncorresponding annealed system is discontinuous. One generally expects the\npresence of disorder to smooth transitions, and it was proved by Giacomin and\nToninelli that when the excursion length distribution has power-law tails, the\nquenched system has a continuous transition even if the annealed system does\nnot. We show here that when the underlying chain is transient but the finite\npart of the excursion length distribution has exponential tails, then the\ndepinning transition is discontinuous even in the quenched system, and the\nquenched and annealed critical points are strictly different. By contrast, in\nthe recurrent case, the depinning behavior depends on the subexponential\nprefactors on the exponential decay of the excursion length distribution, and\nwhen these prefactors decay with an appropriate power law, the quenched\ntransition is continuous even though the annealed one is not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2006 00:47:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this article it is argued that it springs from one common\nintrinsic feature of their density curves. On the other hand, the profound\ndichotomy between the random and the deterministic in the context of Benford's\nLaw is noted here, acknowledging the need to distinguish between them. From its\nvery inception, the field has been suffering from a profound confusion and\nmixing of these two very different logarithmic flavors, causing mistaken\nconclusions. One example is Allaart's proof of equality of sums along digital\nlines, which can only be applied to deterministic processes. Random data lack\nthis equality and consistently show significantly larger sums for lower digits,\nthus rendering any attempt at test of summation equality irrelevant and futile\nin the context of forensic analysis regarding accounting and financial fraud\ndetection.\n  Another digital regularity is suggested here, one that is found in\nlogarithmic as well as non-logarithmic random data sets. In addition, chains of\ndistributions that are linked via parameter selection are found to be\nlogarithmic, either in the limit where the number of the sequences in the chain\napproaches infinity, or where the distributions generating the parameters are\nthemselves logarithmic.\n  A new forensic data analysis method in the context of fraud detection is\nsuggested here even for data types that do not obey Benford's Law, and in\nparticularly regarding tax evasion applications. This can also serve as a\nrobust forensic tool to investigate fraudulent fake data provided by the\nsophisticated cheater already aware of Benford's Law, a challenge that would\nbecome increasing problematic to tax authorities in the future as Benford's Law\nbecomes almost common knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2006 03:21:40 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Sun, 7 Oct 2007 13:19:30 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Mon, 26 Nov 2007 15:14:06 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Wed, 12 Dec 2007 20:31:13 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2008 17:57:42 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2012 18:24:36 GMT"},{"version":"v15","created":"Wed, 7 Mar 2012 17:03:17 GMT"},{"version":"v16","created":"Fri, 20 Apr 2012 17:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v17","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2012 18:12:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2006 15:10:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Jan 2007 00:38:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2007 04:04:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 2007 17:45:16 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 19 Mar 2007 21:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 28 Apr 2007 12:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Tue, 5 Jun 2007 13:40:47 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sat, 7 Jul 2007 08:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-01"}

Averaging these fluctuations, high-quality profiles of mean values and\nturbulence statistics can be obtained in experiments with well-defined initial\nand boundary conditions. Hence, the LES data can be beneficial for assessment\nand optimization of turbulence closure schemes. A database of 80 LES runs for\nneutral and stably stratified PBLs (DATABASE64) is applied in this study to\noptimize the first-order turbulence closure (FOC). Approximations for the\nmixing length scale and stability correction functions have been tuned to\nminimise a relative root-mean square error over the entire DATABASE64. New\nstability functions have correct asymptotes describing regimes of strong and\nweek mixing found in theoretical exercises, atmospheric data and LES. The\ncorrect asymptotes exclude the need for a critical Richardson number in the FOC\nformulation. Further, we analysed the FOC quality as functions of the integral\nPBL stability and the vertical model resolution. We show that the FOC is never\nperfect because the turbulence in the upper half of the PBL is not generated by\nthe local gradients. Accordingly, the parameterized and LES fluxes decorrelate\nin the upper PBL. With this imperfection in mind, we show that there is no\nsystematic quality deterioration of the FOC in strongly stable PBLs provided\nthe vertical model resolution is better than 10 levels within the PBL. In\nagreement with previous studies, we found that the quality improves slowly with\nthe vertical resolution refinement.
