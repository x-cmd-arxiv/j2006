Compact approximate formulae for the amplitudes are obtained. Numerical\ncalculations are done for Q^2 < 0.1 GeV^2 with several realistic form factor\nparameterizations, yielding similar results. They indicate that the corrections\nto magnetic form factor can visibly affect cross-section and proton radii. For\nlow-Q^2 electron-neutron scattering two-photon exchange corrections are shown\nto be negligibly small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2006 14:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nexperiments were performed in ceramic wall capillary discharges at currents of\nup to 120 kA, with an available ID of between 3 and 8 mm and with lengths from\n60 to 100 mm. Initial plasma conditions in the capillary exploit transient\nhollow cathode effects in a preionizing discharge. A laser focussed onto the\nback surface of the cathode initiates both beam activity in the capillary\nvolume and plasma injection. To promote metal ablation into the pinch channel\nof elements other than the ceramic wall material, a number of graded ring\nschemes have been tried. The plasma is observed axially using both time and\nenergy resolved soft X-ray pin hole images as well as from time resolved soft\nX-ray spectra. By varying the rate of rise of the current of the main\ndischarge, and the preionizing conditions the diameter and the stability of the\nZ-pinch column are seen to be affected. The ratio of the species from the\nablated wall material to the plasma formed from the graded ring structure is\nfound to depend both on the capillary dimensions as well as the other operating\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2006 04:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These genome sequences\nare being mined for important functional elements, such as genes. They are also\nbeing compared and contrasted in order to identify other functional sequences,\nsuch as those involved in the regulation of genes. In cases where DNA sequences\nfrom different organisms can be determined to have originated from a common\nancestor, it is natural to try to infer the an- cestral sequences. The\nreconstruction of ancestral genomes can lead to insights about genome\nevolution, and the origins and diversity of function. There are a number of\ninteresting foundational questions associated with reconstructing ancestral\ngenomes: Which statistical models for evolution should be used for making\ninferences about ancestral sequences? How should extant genomes be compared in\norder to facilitate ancestral reconstruction? Which portions of ancestral\ngenomes can be reconstructed reliably, and what are the limits of ancestral\nreconstruction? We discuss recent progress on some of these questions, offer\nsome of our own opinions, and highlight interesting mathematics, statistics,\nand computer science problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2006 21:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here we reexamine\na classic package model in which distinct information carriers or templates are\nforced to coexist within vesicles, which in turn can proliferate freely through\nbinary division. The combined dynamics of vesicles and templates is described\nby a multitype branching process which allows us to write equations for the\naverage number of the different types of vesicles as well as for their\nextinction probabilities. The threshold phenomenon associated to the extinction\nof the vesicle population is studied quantitatively using finite-size scaling\ntechniques.
