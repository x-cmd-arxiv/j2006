K-band data from the 2MASS are used to identify the brightest cluster\ngalaxies (BCGs), and to construct the K-band LF. Our main results include: (1)\nThe surface density profile of radio-loud AGNs is much more concentrated than\nthat of all galaxies, and can be described by the NFW profile with\nconcentration ~ 25. (2) A comparison of the RLFs in the clusters and in the\nfield shows that the cluster AGN number density is about 5,700 times higher,\ncorresponding to a factor of 6.8 higher probability of a galaxy being radio\nactive in the cluster than in the field. We suggest that about 40-50% of\nradio-loud AGNs in clusters may reside in low mass galaxies (M_K>-23). (3) The\nRAFs of cluster galaxies of different stellar mass are estimated. About 5% of\ngalaxies more luminous than the characteristic luminosity (M_K<M_*~-24) host\nradio-loud AGNs. The RAF for BCGs is >30%, and depends on the cluster mass.\nCompare to the field population, cluster galaxies have 5-10 times higher RAF.\nCombining the AGN RLF and spatial distribution within clusters, we estimate\nthat they may inject an energy of ~0.13 keV per particle to the intracluster\nmedium near the cluster center. We also investigate the degree of contamination\nby cluster radio sources on the yields of SZE cluster surveys, and estimate\nthat as many as 10% of clusters detected at 150 GHz may host AGNs whose flux is\ncomparable to the cluster SZE signal.

KPD 1930+2752 is one of the best SN Ia progenitor\ncandidates known today. The object is a double degenerate system consisting of\na subluminous B star and a massive white dwarf. Maxted et al. 2000 conclude\nthat the system mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. This conclusion, however,\nrests on the assumption that the sdB mass is 0.5 Mo. However, recent binary\npopulation synthesis calculations suggest that the mass of an sdB star may\nrange from 0.3 Mo to more than 0.7 Mo. It is therefore important to measure the\nmass of the sdB star simultaneously with that of the white dwarf. Since the\nrotation of the sdB star is tidally locked to the orbit the inclination of the\nsystem can be constrained. An analysis of the ellipsoidal variations in the\nlight curve allows to tighten the constraints derived from spectroscopy. We\nderive the mass-radius relation for the sdB star from a quantitative spectral\nanalysis. The projected rotational velocity is determined for the first time\nfrom high-resolution spectra. In addition a reanalysis of the published light\ncurve is performed. The atmospheric and orbital parameters are measured with\nunprecedented accuracy. In particular the projected rotational velocity\nvrotsini = 92.3 +/- 1.5 km/s is determined. The mass of the sdB is limited\nbetween 0.45 Mo and 0.52 Mo.

We find that, whilst stars with convective cores which\nhave accreted only H-rich matter rejuvenate as expected, those stars which have\naccreted He-rich matter (for example at the end stages of conservative mass\ntransfer) evolve in a way that is qualitatively similar to rejuvenated stars of\nmuch higher metallicity. Thus the effects of non-conservative evolution depend\nstrongly on whether He-rich matter is amongst the portion accreted or ejected.\nThis may lead to a significant divergence in binary evolution paths with only a\nsmall difference in initial assumptions. We compare our models to observed\nsystems and find approximate formulae for the effect of mass accretion on the\neffective age and metallicity of the resulting star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2006 15:45:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Furthermore, the corresponding\nrecombination of the ejecta, e.g., the transition from FeIII to FeII, induces\nconsiderable strengthening of metal line-blanketing at and above the\nphotosphere, blocking more effectively this fading UV flux. SN2005cs was not\ndetected in X-rays, and the upper limit to the X-ray luminosity yields a limit\nto the mass loss rate of the progenitor of about 10^-5 solar masses per year.\nOverall, Swift presents a unique opportunity to capture the early and fast\nevolution of Type II SNe in the UV, providing additional constraints on the\nreddening, the SED shortward of 4000A, and the ionization state and temperature\nof the photon-decoupling regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2006 15:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

The\nlattice parameters calculated show a large decrease in the a-axis for MgB2 +\nC4H6O5 samples, but no change in the c-axis. This is an indication of the\ncarbon substitution into boron coming from C4H6O5, resulting in enhancement of\nresistivity, critical current density, and upper critical field. Specifically,\nthe critical current density value of 25000 Acm2 at 5 K and 8 T for the MgB2 +\n30wt% C4H6O5 sample is higher than that of the un-doped MgB2 by a factor of 21.\nIn addition, resistivity value for all the MgB2 + C4H6O5 samples ranged from 80\nto 90 microohm centimeter at 40 K, which is higher than for un-doped MgB2. The\nincreased resistivity indicates increased impurity scattering due to carbon,\nresulting in enhanced upper critical field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2006 00:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In real life systems, the\ncharacteristics of the jobs (such as release time and processing time) are\nusually unknown and unpredictable beforehand. The system is typically unaware\nof the remaining work in each job or of the ability of the job to take\nadvantage of more resources. Following these observations, we adopt the job\nmodel by Edmonds et al (2000, 2003) in which the jobs go through a sequence of\ndifferent phases. Each phase consists of a certain quantity of work and a\nspeed-up function that models how it takes advantage of the number of\nprocessors it receives. We consider the non-clairvoyant online setting where a\ncollection of jobs arrives at time 0. We consider the metrics setflowtime\nintroduced by Robert et al (2007). The goal is to minimize the sum of the\ncompletion time of the sets, where a set is completed when all of its jobs are\ndone. If the input consists of a single set of jobs, this is simply the\nmakespan of the jobs; and if the input consists of a collection of singleton\nsets, it is simply the flowtime of the jobs. We show that the non-clairvoyant\nstrategy EQUIoEQUI that evenly splits the available processors among the still\nunserved sets and then evenly splits these processors among the still\nuncompleted jobs of each unserved set, achieves a competitive ratio\n(2+\\sqrt3+o(1))\\frac{ln n}{lnln n} for the setflowtime minimization and that\nthis is asymptotically optimal (up to a constant factor), where n is the size\nof the largest set. For makespan minimization, we show that the non-clairvoyant\nstrategy EQUI achieves a competitive ratio of (1+o(1))\\frac{ln n}{lnln n},\nwhich is again asymptotically optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2006 15:19:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2006 21:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We study effect of the correlations between different form\nfactors, in particular as they impact the parity violating asymmetry and the\nextraction of the strangeness form factors. We provide a prescription to\nextract the strangeness form factors from the asymmetry that provides an\nexcellent approximation of the full two-photon correction. The corrected form\nfactors are also appropriate as input for other low-Q analyses, although the\neffects of correlations and two-photon exchange corrections may be different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2006 16:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Hence, the same\nmechanism that causes bridges to collapse under the soldiers step marching\ncould be making the lithosphere fail under the springtide induced magnification\nof mantle resonance resulting in strong earthquakes of unspecified type.
