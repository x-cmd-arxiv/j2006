Also the temperature fluctuations and the CO\nnumber density are only affected to small extent. A numerical experiment\nwithout dynamics shows that the CO cooling process works in principle and\ndrives the atmosphere to a cool radiative equilibrium state.

The new laser-plasma acceleration technique appears\nto constitute the more promising breakthrough in this direction, delivering\nunprecedent field gradients up to TV/m. In this article we give a quantitative\ndescription of the impact of longitudinal wake fields on the electron beam. Our\npaper is based on the solution of Maxwell's equations for the longitudinal\nfield. Our conclusions are valid when the acceleration distance is much smaller\nthan the the overtaking length, that is the length that electrons travel as a\nlight signal from the tail of the bunch overtakes the head of the bunch. This\ncondition is well verified for laser-plasma devices. We calculate a closed\nexpression for the impedance and the wake function that may be evaluated\nnumerically. It is shown that the rate of energy loss in the bunch due to\nradiative interaction is equal to the energy emitted through coherent radiation\nin the far-zone. Furthermore, an expression is found for the asymptotic limit\nof a large distance of the electron beam from the accelerator compared with the\novertaking length. Such expression allows us to calculate analytical solutions\nfor a Gaussian transverse and longitudinal bunch shape.

Moreover, FHR tracings with future poor neonatal outcomes were included\nin the cluster with other suspicious patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2006 16:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A linear map M from R^m to R^n is\ncalled Lorentz-positive if M[L_m] is contained in L_n. We extend the notion of\nconcurrence, which was initially introduced to quantify the entanglement of\nbipartite density matrices, to Lorentz-positive maps and provide an explicite\nformula for it. This allows us to obtain formulae for the concurrence of\narbitrary positive operators taking 2 x 2 complex hermitian matrices as input\nand consequently of arbitrary bipartite density matrices of rank 2. Namely, let\nP: H(2) \\to H(d) be a positive operator, and let \\lambda_1,...,\\lambda_4 be the\ngeneralized eigenvalues of the pencil \\sigma_2(P(X)) - \\lambda det X, in\ndecreasing order, where \\sigma_2 is the second symmetric function of the\nspectrum. Then the concurrence is given by the expression C(P;X) =\n2\\sqrt{\\sigma_2(P(X)) - \\lambda_2 det X}. As an application, we compute the\nconcurrences of the density matrices of all graphs with 2 edges. Similar\nresults apply for a function which we call I-fidelity, with the second largest\ngeneralized eigenvalue \\lambda_2 replaced by the smallest eigenvalue \\lambda_4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2006 15:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
