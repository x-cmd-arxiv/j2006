This suggests that GRB 060614 is likely a more intense\nevent in the traditional short-hard GRB category as would be detected by BATSE.\nEvents like GRB 060614 that seem to defy the traditional short vs. long\nclassification of GRBs may require modification of our classification\nterminology for GRBs. By analogy with supernova classifications, we suggest\nthat GRBs be classified into Type I (typically short and associated with old\npopulations) and Type II (typically long and associated with young\npopulations). We propose that GRB 060614 belongs to Type I, and predict that\nsimilar events will be detected in elliptical galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2006 22:38:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Hydrodynamic interactions are fully taken\ninto account by applying a hybrid simulation scheme, where the charged ions\n(i.e. macroion and electrolyte), propagated via molecular dynamics (MD), are\ncoupled to a Lattice Boltzmann (LB) fluid. In a recent experiment it was shown\nthat, for multivalent salt ions, the mobility $\\mu$ initially increases with\ncharge density $\\sigma$, reaches a maximum and then decreases with further\nincrease of $\\sigma$. The aim of the present work is to elucidate the behaviour\nof $\\mu$ at high values of $\\sigma$. Even for the case of monovalent microions,\nwe find a decrease of $\\mu$ with $\\sigma$. A dynamic Stern layer is defined\nthat includes all the counterions that move with the macroion while subject to\nan external electrical field. The number of counterions in the Stern layer,\n$q_0$, is a crucial parameter for the behavior of $\\mu$ at high values of\n$\\sigma$. In this case, the mobility $\\mu$ depends primarily on the ratio\n$q_0/Q$ (with $Q$ the valency of the macroion). The previous contention that\nthe increase in the distortion of the electric double layer (EDL) with\nincreasing $\\sigma$ leads to the lowering of $\\mu$ does not hold for high\n$\\sigma$. In fact, we show that the deformation of the EDL decreases with\nincrease of $\\sigma$. The role of hydrodynamic interactions is inferred from\ndirect comparisons to Langevin simulations where the coupling to the LB fluid\nis switched off. Moreover, systems with divalent counterions are considered. In\nthis case, at high values of $\\sigma$ the phenomenon of charge inversion is\nfound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2006 23:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
