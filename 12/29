Algorithms for such\nsimulation must be able to handle the following two features: 1. the sharp\nprofiles of ionization and temperature at the ionizing front (I-front) and the\nheating front (T-front), and 2. the fraction of neutral hydrogen within the\nionized sphere is extremely small due to the stiffness of the rate equations of\natom processes. The WENO scheme can properly handle these two features, as it\nhas been shown to have high order of accuracy and good convergence in capturing\ndiscontinuities and complicated structures in fluid as well as to be\nsignificantly superior over piecewise smooth solutions containing\ndiscontinuities. With this algorithm, we show the time-dependence of the\npreheated shell around a UV photon source. In the first stage the I-front and\nT-front are coincident, and propagate with almost the speed of light. In later\nstage, when the frequency spectrum of UV photons is hardened, the speeds of\npropagation of the ionizing and heating fronts are both significantly less than\nthe speed of light, and the heating front is always beyond the ionizing front.\nIn the spherical shell between the I- and T-fronts, the IGM is heated, while\natoms keep almost neutral. The time scale of the preheated shell evolution is\ndependent on the intensity of the photon source. We also find that the details\nof the pre-heated shell and the distribution of neutral hydrogen remained in\nthe ionized sphere are actually sensitive to the parameters used. The WENO\nalgorithm can provide stable and robust solutions to study these details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2006 18:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We propose a new model for\nthese QPOs based on forced oscillations induced in the accretion disk due to a\nstellar asymmetric rotating gravitational or magnetic field. It is shown that\nparticles evolving in a rotating non-axisymmetric field are subject to three\nkinds of resonances: a corotation resonance, a Lindblad resonance due to a\ndriving force, and a parametric resonance due to the time varying epicyclic\nfrequencies. These results are extends by means of 2D numerical simulations of\na simplified version of the accretion disk. The simulations are performed for\nthe Newtonian gravitational potential, as well as for a pseudo-general\nrelativistic potential, which enables us to explore the behavior of the\nresonances around both rotating neutron stars and black holes.

It is argued that the nearly periodic motion induced in the disk\nwill produce high quality factor QPOs.\n  Finally, applying this model to a typical neutron star, we found that the\nstrongest response occurs when the frequency difference of the two modes equals\neither the spin frequency (for \"slow rotators\") or half of it (for \"fast\nrotators\").

Canonical equilibrium is\ndynamically impeded by a weak random perturbation which models homogeneous\ndisorder of undetermined source. We present a simple theoretical description,\nin perfect agreement with Monte Carlo simulations, assuming that the decay of\nthe nonequilibrium metastable state is due, as in equilibrium, to the\ncompetition between the surface and the bulk. This suggests one to accept a\nnonequilibrium \"free-energy\" at a mesoscopic/cluster level, and it ensues a\nnonequilibrium \"surface tension\" with some peculiar low-T behavior. We\nillustrate the occurrence of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena, including:\n(i) Noise-enhanced stabilization of nonequilibrium metastable states; (ii)\nreentrance of the limit of metastability under strong nonequilibrium\nconditions; and (iii) resonant propagation of domain walls. The cooperative\nbehavior of our system may also be understood in terms of a Langevin equation\nwith additive and multiplicative noises. We also studied metastability in the\ncase of open boundaries as it may correspond to a magnetic nanoparticle. We\nthen observe burst-like relaxation at low T, triggered by the additional\nsurface randomness, with scale-free avalanches which closely resemble the type\nof relaxation reported for many complex systems. We show that this results from\nthe superposition of many demagnetization events, each with a well- defined\nscale which is determined by the curvature of the domain wall at which it\noriginates. This is an example of (apparent) scale invariance in a\nnonequilibrium setting which is not to be associated with any familiar kind of\ncriticality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2006 22:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
