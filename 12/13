Unlike most previous work\non the subject - which dealt with shapes as measured by the inertia tensor - we\nfocus here on the shape of the gravitational potential, a quantity more\ndirectly relevant to comparison with observational probes. A further advantage\nis that the potential is less sensitive to the effects of substructure and, as\na consequence, the isopotential surfaces are typically smooth and well\napproximated by concentric ellipsoids. Our main result is that the asphericity\nof the potential increases rapidly towards the center of the halo. The radial\ntrend is more pronounced than expected from constant flattening in the mass\ndistribution, and reflects a strong tendency for dark matter halos to become\nincreasingly aspherical inwards. Near the center the halo potential is\napproximately prolate ((c/a)_0=0.72 +/- 0.04, (b/a)_0=0.78 +/- 0.08), but it\nbecomes increasingly spherical in the outer regions. The principal axes of the\nisopotential surfaces remain well aligned, and in most halos the angular\nmomentum tends to be parallel to the minor axis and perpendicular to the major\naxis. This suggests that galactic disks may form in a plane where the potential\nis elliptical and where its ellipticity varies rapidly with radius.

In comparison\nwith the equivalent dust-filled void model in the Einstein-de Sitter\nbackground, we find that the anisotropy for compensated asymptotically\nexpanding local voids can be larger because second-order effects enhance the\nlinear integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect. However, for local voids that\nexpand sufficiently faster than the asymptotic velocity of the wall, the\nsecond-order effect can suppress the fluctuation due to the linear ISW effect.\nA pair of quasi-linear compensated asymptotic local voids with radius\n(2-3)*10^2 ~h^{-1} Mpc and a matter density contrast ~-0.3 can be observed as\ncold spots with a temperature anisotropy Delta T/T~O(10^{-5}) that might help\nexplain the observed large-angle CMB anomalies.

For large but\nfinite N (i.e. to first order in 1/N) the non-analytic RF fixed point becomes\nunstable, and the disorder flows to an analytic fixed point characterized by\ndimensional reduction. However, for random anisotropy the fixed point remains\nnon-analytic (i.e. exhibits a cusp) and is stable in the 1/N expansion, while\nthe corresponding dimensional-reduction fixed point is unstable. In this case\nthe Schwarz-Soffer inequality does not constrain the 2-point spin correlation.\nWe compute the critical exponents of this new fixed point in a series in 1/N\nand to 2-loop order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2006 02:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

After writing the action\nand the Lagrangian for a spacetime comprised of an interior and an exterior\nregions, with a thin shell as a boundary in between, one finds the Hamiltonian\nusing an ADM description. For spherically symmetric spacetimes, one reduces the\nrelevant constraints. The dynamic and constraint equations are obtained. The\nvacuum solutions yield a division of the theory into two branches, d-2k-1>0\n(which includes general relativity, Born-Infeld type theories) and d-2k-1=0\n(which includes Chern-Simons type theories), where k gives the highest power of\nthe curvature in the Lagrangian. An additional parameter, chi, gives the\ncharacter of the vacuum solutions. For chi=1 the solutions have a black hole\ncharacter.

Since the magic baseline depends\nonly on the density, we study the impact of matter density profile effects and\ndensity uncertainties over this range, and the impact of detector locations off\nthe optimal baseline. We find that the optimal constant density describing the\nphysics over this entire baseline range is about 5% higher than the average\nmatter density. This implies that the magic baseline is significantly shorter\nthan previously inferred. However, while a single detector optimization\nrequires fine-tuning of the (very long) baseline length, its combination with a\nnear detector at a shorter baseline is much less sensitive to the far detector\nlocation and to uncertainties in the matter density. In addition, we point out\ndifferent applications of this baseline which go beyond its excellent\ncorrelation and degeneracy resolution potential. We demonstrate that such a\nlong baseline assists in the improvement of the $\\theta_{13}$ precision and in\nthe resolution of the octant degeneracy.

With this theorem the annihilation cross section is fully\ndetermined by scattering amplitudes. This allows us to separate out\nanalytically the contribution of the positronium formation from the overall\nannihilation cross section.

We explicitly\ndescribe two methods to measure the Pauli operators which generate the\nstabilizer group of a quantum code. First, we show how to measure a Pauli\noperator acting on physical qubits using a single coherent state with large\naverage photon number, displacement operations, and photon detection. Second,\nwe show how to measure the stabilizer operators fault-tolerantly by the\ndeterministic preparation of coherent cat states along with one-bit\nteleportations between a qubit-like encoding of coherent states and physical\nqubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2006 17:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

These are the two-mode squeezed\nstates and the non-Gaussian states obtained from them by photon subtraction.\nThis monotonic correspondence can be expressed analytically in the case of pure\nstates. Numerical analysis shows that this relationship holds to a very good\napproximation even in the mixed state case of the photon-subtracted squeezed\nstates. The Fisher information is evaluated by the CV Bell measurement in the\nlimit of weak signal modulation. Our results suggest that the logarithmic\nnegativity of certain sets of non-Gaussian mixed states can be experimentally\naccessed without homodyne tomography, leading to significant simplification of\nthe experimental procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Dec 2006 02:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
