By combining these color selection criteria, it appears possible\nto define a reasonably complete sample of galaxies to our flux limit over\nspecific redshift ranges. However, the redshift dependence of both the\ncompleteness and sampled range of rest-frame colors poses an ultimate limit to\nthe usefulness of these techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2006 20:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We first investigate\none-sided protocols, where piece selection is based on the states of either the\ntransmitter or the receiver. We show that any such protocol relying only on\npushes, or alternatively only on pulls, is inefficient in disseminating all\npieces to all users.

We consider the concrete case of a scalar field propagating on\nR_+ x R^{D-1} which leads us to study the associated heat kernel through a one\ndimensional (worldline) path integral. To calculate the latter we map it onto\nan auxiliary path integral on the full R^D using an image charge. The main\ntechnical difficulty lies in the fact that a smooth potential on R_+ x R^{D-1}\nextends to a potential which generically fails to be smooth on R^D. This\nimplies that standard perturbative methods fail and must be improved. We\npropose a method to deal with this situation. As a result we recover the known\nheat kernel coefficients on a flat manifold with geodesic boundary, and compute\ntwo additional ones, A_3 and A_{7/2}.

The observed optical spring has an inferred Young's modulus of 1.2 TPa,\n20% stiffer than diamond. The trap is intrinsically cold and reaches an\neffective temperature of 0.8 K, limited by technical noise in our apparatus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Dec 2006 20:04:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Jul 2007 13:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
