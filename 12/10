The technique\nrequires several out-of-focus images of a compact source and the\nsignal-to-noise ratio needs to be good but not unreasonably high. For a given\npattern of surface errors, the expected form of such images can be calculated\ndirectly. We show that it is possible to solve the inverse problem of finding\nthe surface errors from the images in a stable manner using standard numerical\ntechniques. To do this we describe the surface error as a linear combination of\na suitable set of basis functions (we use Zernike polynomials). We present\nsimulations illustrating the technique and in particular we investigate the\neffects of receiver noise and pointing errors. Measurements of the 15-m James\nClerk Maxwell telescope made using this technique are presented as an example.\nThe key result is that good measurements of errors on large spatial scales can\nbe obtained if the input images have a signal-to-noise ratio of order 100 or\nmore. The important advantage of this technique over transmitter-based\nholography is that it allows measurements at arbitrary elevation angles, so\nallowing one to characterise the large scale deformations in an antenna as a\nfunction of elevation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2006 19:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Mar 2007 12:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
