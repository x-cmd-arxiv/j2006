The colour-magnitude diagram that we derive in this way\nreveals a narrow and well defined MS extending down to the 10 sigma detection\nlimit at m_606~26.5, m_814~25, corresponding to stars of ~0.2 Msolar. The\nluminosity function (LF) obtained with these data, once corrected for the\nlimited effects of photometric incompleteness, reveals a remarkable deficiency\nof low-mass stars as well as a radial gradient, in that the LF becomes\nprogressively steeper with radius. Using the mass-luminosity relation\nappropriate for the metallicity of NGC2298, we derive the cluster's global mass\nfunction (GMF) by using a multi-mass Michie-King model. Over the range 0.8 -\n0.2 Msolar, the number of stars per unit mass decreases following a power-law\ndistribution of the type dN/dm \\propto m^(0.5), where, for comparison, typical\nhalo clusters have dN/dm \\propto m^(-1.5). If the IMF of NGC2298 was similar to\nthat of other metal poor halo clusters, like e.g. NGC6397, the present GMF that\nwe obtain implies that this object must have lost of order 85% of its original\nmass, at a rate much higher than that suggested by current models based on the\navailable cluster orbit. The latter may, therefore, need revision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2006 16:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Here we\ndiscuss an evolutionary process that can very significantly limit the formation\nof close double black hole binaries: the vast majority of their potential\nprogenitors undergo a common envelope (CE) phase while the donor, one of the\nmassive binary components, is evolving through the Hertzsprung gap.

A similar process\nalso reduces the merger rates for double neutron stars, by factor of ~5,\neliminating most of the previously predicted ultracompact NS-NS systems.

The result of\nthe symbolic decision procedure is a shared expression (represented by a\ndirected acyclic graph) that implicitly represents the answer to a predicate\nabstraction query.\n  We present symbolic decision procedures for the logic of Equality and\nUninterpreted Functions (EUF) and Difference logic (DIFF) and show that these\nprocedures run in pseudo-polynomial (rather than exponential) time. We then\nprovide a method to construct symbolic decision procedures for simple mixed\ntheories (including the two theories mentioned above) using an extension of the\nNelson-Oppen combination method.

The analysis of the uncertainties of the\navailable theoretical results on the antiprotonic helium HFS shows that the\naccuracy of the value of the dipole magnetic moment of the antiproton\n(currently known to only 0.3 %) may be improved by up to 2 orders of magnitude\nby measuring the splitting of appropriately selected components of the HFS of\nany of the known metastable states. The feasibility of the proposed measurement\nby means of an analog of the triple resonance method is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Dec 2006 14:27:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 2007 08:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Jul 2007 11:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here, we examined the\nrecognition performance of an artificial face recognition system as a function\nof the size of the input images. Recognition performance was quantified with\nthree discriminability measures: Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis, non\nParametric Discriminant Analysis, and mutual information. All of the three\nmeasures revealed a maximum at the same image sizes. Since spatial frequency\ncontent is a function of image size, our data consistently predict the range of\npsychophysical found frequencies. Our results therefore support the notion that\nthe critical band of spatial frequencies for face recognition in humans and\nmachines follows from inherent properties of face images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2006 20:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Our seemingly innocent setting is a one dimensional potential well\nthat is divided into two halves by a thin separating wall. The two half wells\nare populated by the same type and number of particles and are kept at the same\ntemperature. The only difference is in the boundary condition imposed at the\ntwo sides of the separating wall, which is the Dirichlet condition from the\nleft and the Neumann condition from the right. The resulting different energy\nspectra cause a difference in the quantum statistically emerging pressure on\nthe two sides. The net force acting on the separating wall proves to be nonzero\nat any temperature and, after a weak decrease in the low temperature domain, to\nincrease and diverge with a square-root-of-temperature asymptotics for high\ntemperatures. These observations hold for both bosonic and fermionic type\nparticles, but with quantitative differences. We work out several analytic\napproximations to explain these differences and the various aspects of the\nfound unexpectedly complex picture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Dec 2006 16:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Mar 2007 16:13:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 May 2007 07:23:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
