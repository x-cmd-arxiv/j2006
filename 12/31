From the simulations we find the\nrelation between r_{0} and quasar mass and formulate this as a way to estimate\nquasar host dark matter halo masses, quantifying uncertainties due to\ncosmological and IGM parameters, and redshift errors. With this method, we\nexamine data for ~3000 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data\nRelease 3, assuming that the effect of ionizing radiation from quasars (the\nso-called transverse proximity effect) is unimportant (no evidence for it is\nseen in the data.) We find that the best fit host halo mass for SDSS quasars\nwith mean redshift z=3 and absolute G band magnitude -27.5 is log10(M/M_sun) =\n12.48^{+0.53}_{-0.89}. We also use the Lyman-Break Galaxy (LBG) and Lyman alpha\nforest data of Adelberger et al in a similar fashion to constrain the halo mass\nof LBGs to be log10(M/M_sun) = 11.13^{+0.39}_{-0.55}, a factor of ~20 lower\nthan the bright quasars. In addition, we study the redshift distortions of the\nLyman alpha forest around quasars, using the simulations. We use the quadrupole\nto monopole ratio of the quasar-Lyman alpha forest correlation function as a\nmeasure of the squashing effect. We find that this does not have a measurable\ndependence on halo mass, but may be useful for constraining cosmic geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2006 21:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This paper is meant as a stepping stone for an exploration of\nthis long-established theme, through the tinted glasses of a (Hopf and\nRota-Baxter) algebraic point of view. By reviewing, reformulating and\nstrengthening known results, we give evidence for the claim that the use of\nHopf algebra allows for a refined analysis of differential equations. We\nrevisit the renowned Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff-Dynkin formula by the modern\napproach involving Lie idempotents. Approximate solutions to differential\nequations involve, on the one hand, series of iterated integrals solving the\ncorresponding integral equations; on the other hand, exponential solutions.\nEquating those solutions yields identities among products of iterated Riemann\nintegrals. Now, the Riemann integral satisfies the integration-by-parts rule\nwith the Leibniz rule for derivations as its partner; and skewderivations\ngeneralize derivations. Thus we seek an algebraic theory of integration, with\nthe Rota-Baxter relation replacing the classical rule. The methods to deal with\nnoncommutativity are especially highlighted. We find new identities, allowing\nfor an extensive embedding of Dyson-Chen series of time- or path-ordered\nproducts (of generalized integration operators); of the corresponding Magnus\nexpansion; and of their relations, into the unified algebraic setting of\nRota-Baxter maps and their inverse skewderivations.

Understanding the underlying principles\nof electric fields-lipid membrane interactions seems to carry a great\nbiological importance.\n  An argument is presented toward understanding the theoretical aspects of\nelectroporation by using the DLVO theory, which has not been recognized\npreviously in the context of electroporation. Further, the dispersion\ninteractions (with its quantum nature), of the double layer counterions and\nmembrane lipid molecules over the Stern layer are emphasized. The sign of these\nforces is such that they compress the membrane. A parallel is drawn to the\ntheory of thin films. The argument is that the external electric field breaks\nthe symmetry of the disjoining pressures on both sides of a lipid membrane,\nresulting in a protrusion of only few lipid molecules. That compromises the\nmembrane stability on a nanoscale and makes it traversable to ions. The\npresented estimate based on these arguments is consistent to electroporation\nexperiments and existing numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2006 22:18:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
