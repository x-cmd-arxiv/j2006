In a recent paper, Candes\nand Tao (2007) propose the Dantzig selector using $L_1$ regularization and show\nthat it achieves the ideal risk up to a logarithmic factor $\\log p$. Their\ninnovative procedure and remarkable result are challenged when the\ndimensionality is ultra high as the factor $\\log p$ can be large and their\nuniform uncertainty principle can fail.\n  Motivated by these concerns, we introduce the concept of sure screening and\npropose a sure screening method based on a correlation learning, called the\nSure Independence Screening (SIS), to reduce dimensionality from high to a\nmoderate scale that is below sample size. In a fairly general asymptotic\nframework, the correlation learning is shown to have the sure screening\nproperty for even exponentially growing dimensionality. As a methodological\nextension, an iterative SIS (ISIS) is also proposed to enhance its finite\nsample performance. With dimension reduced accurately from high to below sample\nsize, variable selection can be improved on both speed and accuracy, and can\nthen be accomplished by a well-developed method such as the SCAD, Dantzig\nselector, Lasso, or adaptive Lasso.

In that paper, the trio known\nas EPR questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics. The authors argued\nthat the then-new theory should not be considered final because they believed\nit incapable of describing physical reality. The epic battle between Einstein\nand Bohr intensified following the latter's response later the same year. Three\ndecades elapsed before John S. Bell gave a devastating proof that the EPR\nargument was fatally flawed. The modest purpose of our paper is to give a\ncritical analysis of the original EPR paper and point out its logical\nshortcomings in a way that could have been done 70 years ago, with no need to\nwait for Bell's theorem. We also present an overview of Bohr's response in the\ninterest of showing how it failed to address the gist of the EPR argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Dec 2006 01:11:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
