Our analysis shows that they are embedded in\nextended, massive dark matter haloes, and they also have an extended corona of\nhot diffuse gas. Dark matter haloes have experienced adiabatic contraction\nalong their assembly process. The relative ELO dark- to bright-mass content and\nspace distributions show broken homology, and they are consistent with\nobservational results on the dark matter fraction at the central regions, as\nwell as on the gradients of the mass-to-light ratio profiles for boxy\nellipticals, as a function of their stellar masses. These results indicate that\nmassive ellipticals miss stars at their central regions, as compared with less\nmassive ones. Our simulations indicate that these missing baryons could be\nfound beyond the virial radii as a hot, diffuse plasma.

I discuss advances in our\nunderstanding of dust enshrouded star-formation and AGN activity at 0<z<3 from\nIRAS, ISO and Spitzer. The data seem to indicate that about 70% of the\nco-moving star-formation rate density at 0.5<z<3 is obscured by dust and that\nAGN, including obscured sources, account for <20% of the co-moving bolometric\nluminosity density. There is tentative evidence that the mode of star-formation\nchanges as a function of redshift; star-formation at z~2 is preferentially in\nmassive, ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) while z~1 sources are\nluminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) which are about 1 mag fainter than ULIRGs in\nthe near-infrared. This evolution of the star-formation mode, is similar to the\nevolution of the redshift distribution of X-ray sources as a function of X-ray\nluminosity and would suggest an extension of the downsizing hypothesis to\ninclude both AGN and star-forming galaxies. Measuring dust-enshrouded\nstar-formation at z>3 will become possible only with future facilities like\nALMA. Currently, the presence of dust can only be assessed in a small fraction\nof the youngest starbursts at z>5 by looking for redshifted large equivalent\nwidth H_alpha emission in broadband filters like the IRAC 4.5 micron passband.\nH_alpha to UV ratios in these objects are a tracer of dust extinction and\nmeasuring this ratio in GOODS galaxies indicate dust in ~20% of star-forming\ngalaxies at z>5. Finally, implications for reionization based on the measured\nstellar mass density and star-formation rates of galaxies at these redshifts\nare discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2006 23:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Ca5Ir3O12 and Ca4IrO6 are also\nantiferromagnetically ordered below 7.8 K and 12 K, respectively, and show an\nunusually large ratio of the Curie-Weiss temperature to the Neel temperature.\nIn particular, Ca5Ir3O12, which includes both Ir4+ and Ir5+ ions, reveals that\nonly S=1/2 spins of the Ir4+ ions are involved in the magnetic ordering whereas\nS=3/2 spins of the Ir5+ ions remain disordered. All results suggest the\npresence of the geometrical frustration that causes incomplete long-range AFM\norder in these quasi-one-dimensional compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2006 08:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

The centrality independence of the chemical\nfreeze-out temperature observed in Au+Au collisions at RHIC is therefore\ninconsistent with the hypothesis that hadron abundances decouple kinetically\nfrom inelastic hadron-hadron interactions. On the other hand, it is consistent\nwith the hypothesis that chemical decoupling is driven by the quark-hadron\nphase transition, and that the observed universal chemical freeze-out reflects\nits critical temperature, independent of the dynamical state of the collision\nfireball as it passes through the phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Dec 2006 18:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}

We call this nonrelativistic theory Quantum\nThermodynamics (QT). Its conceptual foundations differ from those of (von\nNeumann) quantum statistical mechanics (QSM) and (Jaynes) quantum information\ntheory (QIT), but for thermodynamic equilibrium (TE) states it reduces to the\nsame mathematics, and for zero entropy states it reduces to standard unitary\nQM. The nonlinear dynamical group of QT is construed so that the second law\nemerges as a theorem of existence and uniqueness of a stable equilibrium state\nfor each set of mean values of the energy and the number of constituents. It\nimplements two fundamental ansatzs. The first is that in addition to the\nstandard QM states described by idempotent density operators (zero entropy), a\nstrictly isolated system admits also states that must be described by\nnon-idempotent density operators (nonzero entropy). The second is that for such\nadditional states the law of causal evolution is determined by the simultaneous\naction of a Schroedinger-von Neumann-type Hamiltonian generator and a nonlinear\ndissipative generator which conserves the mean values of the energy and the\nnumber of constituents, and (in forward time) drives any density operator, no\nmatter how far from TE, in the 'direction' of steepest entropy ascent (maximal\nentropy increase). The equation of motion can be solved not only in forward\ntime, to describe relaxation towards TE, but also backwards in time, to\nreconstruct the 'ancestral' or primordial lowest entropy state or limit cycle\nfrom which the system originates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2006 13:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
