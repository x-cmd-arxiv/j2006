Two\ntest simulations each with 3 billion particles and 400 million rays in a 50\nMpc/h box have been run to give initial results. Halos are resolved down to\nvirial temperatures of 10^4 K for the redshift range of interest in order to\nrobustly model star formation and clumping factors. This is essential to\ncorrectly account for ionization and recombination processes. We find that the\nhalos and sources are strongly biased with respect to the underlying dark\nmatter, re-enforcing the requirement of large simulation boxes to minimize\ncosmic variance and to obtain a qualitatively correct picture of reionization.\nWe model the stellar initial mass function (IMF), by following the spatially\ndependent gas metallicity evolution, and distinguish between the first\ngeneration, Population III (PopIII) stars and the second generation, Population\nII (PopII) stars. The PopIII stars with a top-heavy IMF produce an order of\nmagnitude more ionizing photons at high redshifts z>10, resulting in a more\nextended reionization.

We show that Seyferts are less\nclustered than LINERs, and that this difference is not driven by the\nmorphology-density relation, but it is related to the difference in clustering\nas a function of level of activity in these systems and the amount of fuel\navailable for accretion. LINERs, which are the most clustered among AGN, show\nthe lowest luminosities and obscuration levels, and relatively low gas\ndensities, suggesting that these objects harbor black holes that are relatively\nmassive yet weakly active or inefficient in their accretion, probably due to\nthe insufficiency of their fuel supply. Seyferts, which are weakly clustered,\nare very luminous, show generally high gas densities and large quantities of\nobscuring material, suggesting that in these systems the black holes are less\nmassive but abundantly fueled and therefore accrete quickly and probably\nefficiently enough to clearly dominate the ionization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2006 21:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

At the\ncore of algebraic signal processing is the concept of a linear signal model\ndefined as a triple (A, M, phi), where familiar concepts like the filter space\nand the signal space are cast as an algebra A and a module M, respectively, and\nphi generalizes the concept of the z-transform to bijective linear mappings\nfrom a vector space of, e.g., signal samples, into the module M. A signal model\nprovides the structure for a particular linear signal processing application,\nsuch as infinite and finite discrete time, or infinite or finite discrete\nspace, or the various forms of multidimensional linear signal processing. As\nsoon as a signal model is chosen, basic ingredients follow, including the\nassociated notions of filtering, spectrum, and Fourier transform. The shift\noperator is a key concept in the algebraic theory: it is the generator of the\nalgebra of filters A. Once the shift is chosen, a well-defined methodology\nleads to the associated signal model. Different shifts correspond to infinite\nand finite time models with associated infinite and finite z-transforms, and to\ninfinite and finite space models with associated infinite and finite\nC-transforms (that we introduce). In particular, we show that the 16 discrete\ncosine and sine transforms are Fourier transforms for the finite space models.\nOther definitions of the shift naturally lead to new signal models and to new\ntransforms as associated Fourier transforms in one and higher dimensions,\nseparable and non-separable. We explain in algebraic terms shift-invariance\n(the algebra of filters A is commutative), the role of boundary conditions and\nsignal extensions, the connections between linear transforms and linear finite\nGauss-Markov fields, and several other concepts and connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2006 20:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 2019 15:24:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

After summarizing the experimental knowledge on superconductivity\naround 1920, the topic is then discussed both on a phenomenological level in\nterms of implications of Maxwell's equations for the case of infinite\nconductivity, and on a microscopic level in terms of suggested models for\nsuperconductive charge transport. Analyzing Einstein's manuscripts and\ncorrespondence as well as his own 1922 paper on the subject, it is shown that\nEinstein had a sustained interest in superconductivity and was well informed\nabout the phenomenon.

Now we show that people's understanding of complex\nsystems in their cognitive maps also follow a scale-free topology (P_k =\nk^-lambda, lambda [1.24,3.03]; r^2 <= 0.95). People focus on a few attributes,\nas indicated by a fat tail in the probability distribution of total degree.\nThese few attributes are related with many other variables in the system. Many\nmore attributes have very few connections. The scale-free properties in the\ncognitive maps of people arise despite the fact that their average distances\nare not different (Wilcoxon sign-rank test, W=78, p=0.75) than random networks\nof the same size and connection density. The scale-free property manifests\nitself in the higher hierarchical structure compared to random networks\n(Wilcoxon sign-rank test, W=12, p=0.03).
