We used the MURaM code to obtain a\nrealistic model of the near-surface layers of the convection zone and the\nphotosphere. The pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations at the base of\nthe photosphere consists of relatively hot granular cells bounded by the cooler\nintergranular downflow network. With increasing height in the photosphere, the\namplitude of the temperature fluctuations diminishes. At a height of z=130-140\nkm in the photosphere, the pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations\nreverses so that granular regions become relatively cool compared to the\nintergranular network. Detailed analysis of the trajectories of fluid elements\nthrough the photosphere reveal that the motion of the fluid is non-adiabatic,\nowing to strong radiative cooling when approaching the surface of optical depth\nunity followed by reheating by the radiation field from below. The temperature\nstructure of the photosphere results from the competition between expansion of\nrising fluid elements and radiative heating. The former acts to lower the\ntemperature of the fluid whereas the latter acts to increase it towards the\nradiative equilibrium temperature with a net entropy gain. After the fluid\noverturns and descends towards the convection zone, radiative energy loss again\ndecreases the entropy of the fluid. Radiative heating and cooling of fluid\nelements that penetrate into the photosphere and overturn do not occur in equal\namounts. The imbalance in the cumulative heating and cooling of these fluid\nelements is responsible for the reversal of temperature fluctuations with\nrespect to height in the photosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Dec 2006 03:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In CDMA signature optimization, for a particular user, the\nreceiver selects a signature vector from a codebook to best avoid interference\nfrom other users, and then feeds the corresponding index back to the specified\nuser. For MIMO beamforming vector selection, the receiver chooses a beamforming\nvector from a given codebook to maximize throughput, and feeds back the\ncorresponding index to the transmitter. These two problems are dual: both can\nbe modeled as selecting a unit norm vector from a finite size codebook to\n\"match\" a randomly generated Gaussian matrix.
