Weak\nforbidden emission lines are expected from several s-process elements in these\nshells, and have been searched for and in some cases detected in previous\ninvestigations. Here we extend these studies by combining very high\nsignal-to-noise echelle spectra of a sample of PNe with a critical analysis of\nthe identification of the emission lines of Z>30 ions. Emission lines of Br,\nKr, Xe, Rb, Ba, and Pb are detected with a reasonable degree of certainty in at\nleast some of the objects studied here, and we also tentatively identify lines\nfrom Te and I, each in one object. The strengths of these lines indicate\nenhancement of s-process elements in the central star progenitors, and we\ndetermine the abundances of Br, Kr, and Xe, elements for which atomic data\nrelevant for abundance determination have recently become available. As\nrepresentative elements of the ``light'' and ``heavy'' s-process peaks Kr and\nXe exhibit similar enhancements over solar values, suggesting that PNe\nprogenitors experience substantial neutron exposure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2006 23:03:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2006 23:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Furthermore, the\n[CN/H]-sigma and [CN/Fe]-sigma slopes are steeper for galaxies in very rich\nclusters than those in the less dense Virgo and Coma clusters. On the other\nhand, [Mg/H]-sigma and [Mg/Fe]-sigma slopes keep constant as functions of the\nenvironment. Our results are compatible with a scenario in which the stellar\npopulations of massive elliptical galaxies, independently of their environment\nand mass, had formation timescales shorter than ~1 Gyr. This result implies\nthat massive elliptical galaxies have evolved passively since, at least, as\nlong ago as z~2. For a given galaxy mass the duration of star formation is\nshorter in those galaxies belonging to more dense environments; whereas the\nmass-metallicity relation appears to be also a function of the cluster\nproperties: the denser the environment is, the steeper are the correlations.\nFinally, we show that the abundance ratios [CN/Fe] and [Mg/Fe] are the key\n\"chemical clocks\" to infer the star formation history timescales in\nellipticals. In particular, [Mg/Fe] provides an upper limit for those formation\ntimescales, while [CN/Fe] apperars to be the most suitable parameter to resolve\nthem in elliptical galaxies with sigma<300 km/s.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2006 11:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

To date, observations have\npresented somewhat contradictory evidence relating to this issue. Aims: In this\npaper we propose to derive the mass function of a complete sample of dense\nmolecular cores in a single cloud employing a robust method that uses uses\nextinction of background starlight to measure core masses and enables the\nreliable extension of such measurements to lower masses than previously\npossible. Methods: We use a map of near-infrared extinction in the nearby Pipe\ndark cloud to identify the population of dense cores in the cloud and measure\ntheir masses. Results: We identify 159 dense cores and construct the mass\nfunction for this population. We present the first robust evidence for a\ndeparture from a single power-law form in the mass function of a population of\ncores and find that this mass function is surprisingly similar in shape to the\nstellar IMF but scaled to a higher mass by a factor of about 3. This suggests\nthat the distribution of stellar birth masses (IMF) is the direct product of\nthe dense core mass function and a uniform star formation efficiency of\n30%+/-10%, and that the stellar IMF may already be fixed during or before the\nearliest stages of core evolution. These results are consistent with previous\ndust continuum studies which suggested that the IMF directly originates from\nthe core mass function. The typical density of ~10^4/cm^3 measured for the\ndense cores in this cloud suggests that the mass scale that characterizes the\ndense core mass function may be the result of a simple process of thermal\n(Jeans) fragmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Dec 2006 15:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-06-21"}

One difficulty is\nthat grains can behave like a solid (in a sand pile), a liquid (when poured\nfrom a silo) or a gas (when strongly agitated). For the two extreme regimes,\nconstitutive equations have been proposed based on kinetic theory for\ncollisional rapid flows, and soil mechanics for slow plastic flows.

For a Kerr BH, all multipole moments of\nthe spacetime have a simple, unique relation to $M$ and $S$, the BH's mass and\nspin; in particular, the spacetime's mass quadrupole moment is given by $Q=-\nS^2/M$. Here we treat $Q$ as an additional parameter, independent of $M$ and\n$S$, and ask how well observation can constrain its difference from the Kerr\nvalue.

Non-commutative geometry is a promising mathematical framework which\nalready allowed to unify the general relativity and the standard model, at the\nclassical level, thanks to the spectral action principle. Quantum field\ntheories on non-commutative spaces is a first step towards the quantification\nof such a model. These theories can't be obtained simply by writing usual field\ntheory on non-commutative spaces. Such attempts exhibit indeed a new type of\ndivergencies, called ultraviolet/infrared mixing, which prevents\nrenormalisability. H. Grosse and R. Wulkenhaar showed, with an example, that a\nmodification of the propagator may restore renormalisability. This thesis aims\nat studying the generalization of such a method. We studied two different\nmodels which allowed to specify certain aspects of non-commutative field\ntheory. In x space, the major technical difficulty is due to oscillations in\nthe interaction part. We generalized the results of T. Filk in order to exploit\nsuch oscillations at best. We were then able to distinguish between two\nmixings, renormalizable or not. We also bring the notion of orientability to\nlight : the orientable non-commutative Gross-Neveu model is renormalizable\nwithout any modification of its propagator.

In this paper we present a study of classical\northogonal polynomials in a more general context by using the differential (or\ndifference) calculus and Operator Theory. In such a way we obtain a unified\nrepresentation of them. Furthermore, some well known results related to the\nRodrigues operator are deduced. A more general characterization Theorem that\nthe one given in [1] and [2] for the q-polynomials of the q-Askey and Hahn\nTableaux, respectively, is established. Finally, the families of Askey-Wilson\npolynomials, q-Racah polynomials, Al-Salam & Carlitz I and II, and q-Meixner\nare considered.\n  [1] R. Alvarez-Nodarse.

In particular, we focus on\nchannels build using feasible photon-number entangled states (PNES) as two-mode\ncoherently-correlated (TMC) or twin-beam (TWB) states and compare their\nperformances with that of channels built using feasible classically correlated\n(separable) states.

Optimized bit\ndiscrimination thresholds, as well as the corresponding maximized mutual\ninformation, are explicitly evaluated as a function of the beam intensity and\nthe loss parameter. The propagation of TMC and TWB in lossy channels is\nanalyzed and the joint photon number distribution is evaluated, showing that\nthe beam statistics, either sub-Poissonian for TMC or super-Poissonian for TWB,\nis not altered by losses. Although entanglement is not strictly needed to\nestablish the channels, which are based on photon-number correlations owned\nalso by separable mixed states, purity of the support state is relevant to\nincrease security.
