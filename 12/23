A simple flux transport model for the\nazimuthally averaged radial magnetic field at the solar surface is used, which\ncontains a source term describing the emergence of new flux based on\nobservational sunspot data. We consider the magnetic flux diffusing over the\nequator as a predictor, since this quantity is directly related to the global\ndipole field from which a Babcock-Leighton dynamo generates the toroidal field\nfor the next activity cycle. If the source is represented schematically by a\nnarrow activity belt drifting with constant speed over a fixed range of\nlatitudes between activity minima, our predictor shows considerable predictive\nskill with correlation coefficients up to 0.95 for past cycles. However, the\npredictive skill is completely lost when the actually observed emergence\nlatitudes are used. This result originates from the fact that the precursor\namplitude is determined by the sunspot activity a few years before solar\nminimum. Since stronger cycles tend to rise faster to their maximum activity\n(known as the Waldmeier effect), the temporal overlapping of cycles leads to a\nshift of the minimum epochs that depends on the strength of the following\ncycle. This information is picked up by precursor methods and also by our flux\ntransport model with a schematic source. Therefore, their predictive skill does\nnot require a memory, i.e., a physical connection between the surface\nmanifestations of subsequent activity cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2006 16:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

There is only a weak (tens of\nper cent) dependence on the power \\beta describing the growth of the supernova\nrate with the redshift. Different original neutrino spectra correspond to large\ndifferences in the observed spectrum of events at a water Cerenkov detector:\nfor typical supernova rates, the ratio of the numbers of events in the first\nand second energy bins (of 5 MeV width) varies in the interval 1.5 - 4.3 for\npure water (energy threshold 18 MeV) and in the range 1 - 2.5 for water with\nGadolinium (10 MeV threshold).

Field penetration may help to\nexplain electroluminescence associated with field emitting carbon nanotubes.\nCharge-density oscillations, induced by the hydrogen adsorption, are also\nfound.

Predicted FEF values for these SWCNTs are\nsignificantly less than values predicted by simple classical formulae. The FEF\nfor the closed SWCNT decreases with applied field; the FEF for the H-terminated\nopen SWCNT is less than the FEF for the closed SWCNT, but increases with\napplied field.

Overall, the predicted field emission\nperformance of the H-terminated open SWCNT is slightly better than that of the\nclosed SWCNT, essentially because a C-H dipole is formed that reduces the\nheight of the tunnelling barrier.

For a given coupling\narchitecture, the delays introduce correlations in the time series at the\ntime-scale of the delay.

We use this result to introduce a minimal language\ncombining higher-order computation and linear algebra. This language extends\nthe Lambda-calculus with the possibility to make arbitrary linear combinations\nof terms alpha.t + beta.u. We describe how to \"execute\" this language in terms\nof a few rewrite rules, and justify them through the two fundamental\nrequirements that the language be a language of linear operators, and that it\nbe higher-order. We mention the perspectives of this work in the field of\nquantum computation, whose circuits we show can be easily encoded in the\ncalculus. Finally, we prove the confluence of the entire calculus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2006 17:25:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Mar 2008 18:14:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2015 15:19:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 13 Mar 2017 09:42:01 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2017 08:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2017 16:23:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-03-14"}
