An excellent broadband spectrum was\nobtained over two decades of frequency (0.6 to 50 keV) within each 40 ksec\nexposure.

The constructing method for the natural coordinate\nsystem is concretely provided, and its physical and geometrical meanings are\ndiscussed in detail. In NCS we make classical approximation of spinor equation\nto get Newtonian mechanics, and then make weak field approximation of\nEinstein's equation and low speed approximation of particles moving in the\nspace-time. From the analysis and examples we find it is a nice coordinate\nsystem to describe the realistic curved space-time, and is helpful to\nunderstand the nature of space-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Dec 2006 07:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Sep 2017 13:23:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2017 06:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-27"}

This allows\nus to classify the f(R) models into four general classes, depending on the\nexistence of a standard matter epoch and on the final accelerated stage. The\nexistence of a viable matter dominated epoch prior to a late-time acceleration\nrequires that the variable m satisfies the conditions m(r) approx+0 and\ndm/dr>-1 at r approx-1.

Neither argument is found to be satisfactory as it stands,\nalthough an improved version of one of the arguments can in fact be given. This\nimproved version turns out to be still not completely unproblematic, but it is\nargued that it contains only a single actual loophole, which is identical to a\nloophole that remains in experimental proofs of nonlocality of Bell-type. It is\nconcluded that - within the context of the standard quantum kinematical\nframework and in agreement with what has been concluded by earlier authors - a\nnonlinear dynamics of density operators is inconsistent with relativistic\ncausality. However, it is also stressed that this conclusion in itself has\nlittle implication for the nature of dynamics at the Hilbert space level - in\nparticular, it does not force dynamics to be linear at this level - nor does it\ncontinue to be valid in contexts that go beyond the standard quantum\nkinematical framework. Despite their seeming triviality, these last two points\nhave not always been appreciated in the literature. Finally, it is also pointed\nout that the argument for complete positivity, as given in conjunction with one\nof the two recent arguments for linear dynamics, in fact only establishes a\ncondition that is weaker than complete positivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 Dec 2006 20:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-18"}
