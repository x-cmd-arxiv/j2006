We determine masses and mass-to-light ratios of five ultra-compact\ndwarf galaxies and one dwarf elliptical nucleus in the Fornax cluster from high\nresolution spectroscopy. Methods. Velocity dispersions were derived from\nselected wavelength regions using a direct-fitting method. To estimate the\nmasses of the UCDs a new modelling program has been developed that allows a\nchoice of different representations of the surface brightness profile (i.e.\nNuker, Sersic or King laws) and corrects the observed velocity dispersions for\nobservational parameters (i.e. seeing, slit size). Results. The observed\nvelocity dispersions range between 22 and 30 km/s. The resulting masses are\nbetween 1.8 and 9.5x10^7M_sun. These, as well as the central and global\nprojected velocity dispersions, were derived from the generalized King model\nwhich turned out to give the most stable results. The masses of two UCDs, that\nare best fitted by a two-component profile, were derived from a combined\nKing+Sersic model. The mass-to-light ratios of the Fornax UCDs range between 3\nand 5 (M/L_V)_sun. Within 1-2 half-mass radii dark matter is not dominating\nUCDs. Conclusions. We show that the mass-to-light ratios of UCDs in Fornax are\nconsistent with those expected for pure stellar populations. Thus UCDs seem to\nbe the result of cluster formation processes within galaxies rather than being\ncompact dark matter dominated substructures themselves. Whether UCDs gained\ntheir mass in super-star cluster complexes of mergers or in nuclear star\ncluster formation processes remains an open question.

It is found that the second Gegenbauer\ncoefficients of scalar density twist-3 distribution amplitudes for $K^{*}_0$\nand $f_0$ mesons are quite close to that for $a_0$, which indicates that the\nSU(3) symmetry breaking effect is tiny here. However, this effect could not be\nneglected for the forth Gegenbauer coefficients of scalar twist-3 distribution\namplitudes between $a_0$ and $f_0$.

We first introduce a model of the\ncollapse of the star. We suppose that the space-time outside the star is given\nby the Kerr-Newman metric. The assumptions on the asymptotic behavior of the\nsurface of the star are inspired by the asymptotic behavior of certain timelike\ngeodesics in the Kerr-Newman metric. The Dirac equation is then written using\ncoordinates and a Newman-Penrose tetrad which are adapted to the collapse. This\ncoordinate system and tetrad are based on the so called simple null geodesics.\nThe quantization of Dirac fields in a globally hyperbolic space-time is\ndescribed. We formulate and prove a theorem about the Hawking effect in this\nsetting.

In contrast with the case of three interfering plane waves, in\nwhich an infinitely-extended vortex lattice is generated, the spherical sources\ngenerate a finite number of phase vortices. Analytical expressions for the\nvortex core locations are developed and shown to have a convenient\nrepresentation in a discrete parameter space. Our analysis may be mapped onto\nthe case of a coherently-illuminated Young's interferometer, in which the\nscreen is punctured by three rather than two pinholes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2006 05:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 187901 (2004)] gave a method\nfor preparing an arbitrary quantum state with high success probability by\nphysically transmitting some qubits, and by consuming a maximally entangled\nstate, together with exhausting some shared random bits. In this paper, we\ndiscover that some states are impossible to be perfectly prepared by Alice and\nBob initially sharing those entangled states that are superposed by the ground\nstates, as the states to be prepared. In particular, we present a sufficient\nand necessary condition for the states being enabled to be exactly prepared\nwith probability one, in terms of the initial entangled states (maybe\nnonmaximally) superposed by the ground states. In contrast, if the initially\nshared entanglement is maximal, then the probabilities for preparing these\nquantum states are smaller than one. Furthermore, the lower bound on the\nprobability for preparing some states are derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2006 05:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-10"}

The\noscillations are interpreted as interferences and correspond to various\nclosed-orbits of the emitted photon going away from and returning to the atom.\nThis system provides a rare example that the oscillations can be explicitly\nderived by following the emitted wave until it returns to the emitting atom.
