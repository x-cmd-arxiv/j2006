This simulation did not launch an explosion\nuntil over 600ms after collapse, allowing an ideal opportunity to study the\nevolution and structure of the convection below the accretion shock to late\ntimes. This late-time convection allows us to study several of the recent\nclaims in the literature about the role of convection: is it dominated by an\nl=1 mode driven by vortical-acoustic (or other) instability, does it produce\nstrong neutron star kicks, and, finally, is it the key to a new explosion\nmechanism? The convective region buffets the neutron star, imparting a 150-200\nkm/s kick. Because the l=1 mode does not dominate the convection, the neutron\nstar does not achieve large (>450 km/s) velocities. Finally, the neutron star\nin this simulation moves, but does not develop strong oscillations, the energy\nsource for a recently proposed supernova engine. We discuss the implications\nthese results have on supernovae, hypernovae (and gamma-ray bursts), and\nstellar-massed black holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2006 16:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In chronological order they are: the burst\ntail, the \"hump\", the standard decay, and the post jet-break decay.\n  The large-angle emission produced during the burst, but arriving at observer\nlater, is consistent with the GRB tail decay for less than half of bursts. The\nforward-shock synchrotron emission from a very narrow jet (half-angle less than\n1 deg) is consistent with the decay of 75 percent of GRB tails. The\nforward-shock inverse-Compton emission from a narrow jet that does not expand\nsideways also accommodates the decay of 80 percent of GRB tails.\n  The X-ray light-curve hump can be attributed to an increasing kinetic energy\nper solid angle of the forward-shock region visible to the observer. This\nincrease could be due to the emergence of the emission from an outflow seen\nfrom a location outside its opening. However, the correlations among the hump\ntiming, flux, and decay index expected in this model are not confirmed by\nobservations. Thus, the increase in the forward-shock kinetic energy is more\nlikely caused by some incoming ejecta arriving at the shock during the\nafterglow phase.\n  The jet interpretation for the burst tails and the energy injection scenario\nfor the hump lead to a double-jet outflow structure consisting of a narrow GRB\njet which precedes a wider afterglow outflow of lower kinetic energy per solid\nangle but higher total energy.

One way to construct Dedekind Eta function\nto use the explicit formula (Kroncker limit formula) for the regularized\ndeterminants of the Laplacian of the flat metric acting of (0,1) forms on\nelliptic curves. The holomorphic part of the regularized determinant is the\nDedekind eta functions. In this paper we generalized the above approach to the\ncase of K3 surfaces. We give an explicit formula of the regularized\ndeterminants of the Laplacians of Calabi Yau metrics on K3 Surfaces, following\nsuggestions by R. Borcherds. The holomorphic part of the regularized\ndeterminants will be the higher dimensional analogue of Dedekind Eta function.\nWe give explicit formulas for the number of non singular rational curves with a\nfixed volume with respect to a Hodge metric in the case of K3 surfaces with\nPicard group unimodular even lattice by using the holomorphic part exp_{3,19}\nof the regularized determinants det_{(0,1)}. We gave the combinatorial\ninterpretation of the restriction of the automorphic form exp_{3,19} on the\nmoduli of K3 surfaces with unimodular Picard lattices in the A and B models.\nThe results obtained in this paper are related to some results of Bershadsky,\nCecotti, Ouguri and Vafa.

An autocorrelation function Corr(Delta t) = <TS(t) TS(t+Delta t)> was\nthen calculated, and averaged over all patients. Positive Corr(Delta t)\nindicates that TS at a given hour and Delta t hours later are similar. TO was\ntreated likewise.
