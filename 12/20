We find that\nmicrolensing is insensitive to the slope of the mass function but does depend\non the mass range. For negative parity images, diluting the stellar population\nwith dark matter increases the magnification dispersion for small sources and\ndecreases it for large sources. This implies that the quasar continuum and\nbroad-line regions may experience very different microlensing in\nnegative-parity lensed images. We confirm earlier conclusions that the surface\nbrightness profile and geometry of the source have little effect on\nmicrolensing. Finally, we consider non-circular sources. We show that\nelliptical sources that are aligned with the direction of shear have larger\nmagnification dispersions than sources with perpendicular alignment, an effect\nthat becomes more prominent as the ellipticity increases.

A finite-size scaling analysis of the location parameter\nyields a critical temperature and critical exponents in agreement with previous\nresults. This suggests that the location parameter is a good observable. There\nhave been conflicting claims as to whether the superfluid density vanishes in\nthe vortex glass phase, with Fisher et al. [Phys.

Because the gauge glass is commonly used to\ndescribe the vortex glass in high-temperature superconductors, we discuss this\nissue in light of our results on the gauge glass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2006 08:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jun 2007 02:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-21"}

First, analytical models are\nderived for the cases where certain parameters (channel energy, average energy,\nspatial correlation matrix) are known deterministically. Frequently, these\nparameters are unknown (typically because the received energy or the spatial\ncorrelation varies with the user position), but still known to represent\nmeaningful system characteristics. In these cases, analytical channel models\nare derived by assigning entropy-maximizing distributions to these parameters,\nand marginalizing them out. For the MIMO case with spatial correlation, we show\nthat the distribution of the covariance matrices is conveniently handled\nthrough its eigenvalues. The entropy-maximizing distribution of the covariance\nmatrix is shown to be a Wishart distribution. Furthermore, the corresponding\nprobability density function of the channel matrix is shown to be described\nanalytically by a function of the channel Frobenius norm.

Until\nrecently it has been impossible to reliably derive the predictions of General\nRelativity for the final merger stage, which takes place in the strong-field\nregime.

We examine here the\nspecific case of merging equal-mass Schwarzschild black holes in detail,\npresenting new simulations in which the black holes start in the late inspiral\nstage on orbits with very low eccentricity and evolve for ~1200M through ~7\norbits before merging.

This\nexclusion of the Higgs from propagating into an otherwise universal extra\ndimension violates tree-level Kaluza-Klein number conservation in the Yukawa\ninteractions. As a consequence, there is inter-mode mixing between fermions.\nFor example, zero-mode fermions mix with their associated Kaluza-Klein\nexcitations. This is in contrast to the original universal extra dimensions\nscenario, in which conservation of Kaluza-Klein number prohibits such\ninter-mode mixing. Inter-mode mixing is especially significant for the top\nquark, since its mass (171.4 +/- 2.1 GeV) is approximately one-half the current\nTevatron mass bound (~350-400 GeV) for Kaluza-Klein excitations of quarks\npropagating into universal extra dimensions. We compute the effects that mixing\namong the zero-modes and lowest-lying Kaluza-Klein excitations has on the\nlightest third-generation charge 2/3 quark mass eigenvalue in the non-universal\nHiggs model with one otherwise universal extra dimension. Another consequence\nof the inter-mode mixing is that the Kaluza-Klein excitations of the fermions\ncan decay to a zero-mode Higgs and a corresponding zero-mode fermion. As a\nresult, the pair production of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the top quark would\nlead to two zero-mode Higgs bosons plus a zero-mode top quark/anti-quark pair.\nWe compute the cross section that the non-universal Higgs model contributes to\nHiggs production at the Large Hadron Collider.

Let\n$M$ be a compact manifold with negative sectional curvature and suppose that\nalong every geodesic in $M$ there is a parallel vector field making curvature\n$-a^2$ with the geodesic direction. We prove that $M$ has constant curvature\nequal to $-a^2$ if $M$ is odd dimensional, or if $M$ is even dimensional and\nhas sectional curvature pinched as follows: $-\\Lambda^2 < K < -\\lambda^2$ where\n$\\lambda/\\Lambda > .93$. When $a$ is extremal, i.e. $-a^2$ is the curvature\nminimum or maximum for the manifold, this result is analogous to rank rigidity\nresults in various other curvature settings where higher rank implies that the\nspace is locally symmetric. In particular, this result is the first positive\nresult for lower rank (i.e. when $-a^2$ is minimal), and in the upper rank case\ngives a shorter proof of the hyperbolic rank rigidity theorem of\nHamenst\\\"{a}dt, subject to the pinching condition in even dimension. We also\npresent a rigidity result using only an assumption on maximal Lyapunov\nexponents in direct analogy with work done by Connell.

Furthermore, in general practical\napplications, as it has been pointed out in the very first paper, the use of\nthermal noise is disadvantageous therefore the issue of temperature and its\naccuracy is unimportant even for the security of common practical realizations.\nIt is important to emphasize that any deviation from the idealized scheme can\nlead to a finite level of security.

This class includes both Gaussian and non Gaussian CV states, as for\nexample twin-beam (TWB) and pair-coherent (TMC, also known as two-mode-coher\nent) states respectively. Under resonance conditions, equal interaction times\nfor both qubits and different initial preparations, we find that the\nentanglement transfer is more efficient for TMC than for TWB states. In the\nperspective of applications such as in cavity QED or with superconducting\nqubits, we analyze in details the effects of off-resonance interactions\n(detuning) and different interaction times for the two qubits, and discuss\nconditions to preserve the entanglement transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Dec 2006 07:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 2007 10:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
