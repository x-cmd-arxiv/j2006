The master equation approach to FCS\nintroduced in Ref. [12] is applied to derive a generating function yielding the\nFCS of charge and current. In the master equation approach, Clebsch-Gordan\ncoefficients appear in the transition probabilities, whereas the derivation of\ngenerating function reduces to solving the eigenvalue problem of a modified\nmaster equation with counting fields.

It is known that if the universal LZ77 data\ncompression algorithm is successively applied to N-blocks then the best\nerror-free compression for the particular individual sequence X is achieved, as\n$N$ tends to infinity. The best possible compression that may be achieved by\nany universal data compression algorithm for finite N-blocks is discussed. It\nis demonstrated that context tree coding essentially achieves it. Next,\nconsider a device called classifier (or discriminator) that observes an\nindividual training sequence X. The classifier's task is to examine individual\ntest sequences of length N and decide whether the test N-sequence has the same\nfeatures as those that are captured by the training sequence X, or is\nsufficiently different, according to some appropriatecriterion.

In this\npaper, we propose new criteria for choosing the damping factor, based on the\nergodic structure of the Web Graph and probability flows. Specifically, we\nrequire that the core component receives a fair share of the PageRank mass.\nUsing singular perturbation approach we conclude that the value c=0.85 is too\nhigh and suggest that the damping factor should be chosen around 1/2. As a\nby-product, we describe the ergodic structure of the OUT component of the Web\nGraph in detail. Our analytical results are confirmed by experiments on two\nlarge samples of the Web Graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2006 08:48:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this report, we formulate these three\nideas using the mathematics of two coupled oscillators. It is shown that the\nidea of entanglement is contained in his rest of the universe, and can be\nextended to a space-time entanglement. It is shown also that his parton model\nand the static quark model can be combined into one Lorentz-covariant entity.\nFurthermore, Einstein's special relativity, based on the Lorentz group, can\nalso be formulated within the mathematical framework of two coupled\noscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Dec 2006 15:52:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 2007 06:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
