Based on this\nresult, we investigate the dependent quantum cloner in the sense that some\nparameter of the input qubit $\\rho_s(\\theta,\\omega,\\lambda)$ is regarded as\nconstant in the fidelity. For the case of constant $\\omega$, we establish the\n$1\\to2$ optimal symmetric dependent cloner with a fidelity 1/2. It is also\nshown that the $1\\to M$ optimal quantum cloning machine for pure qubits is also\noptimal for mixed qubits, when $\\lambda$ is the unique parameter in the\nfidelity. For general $N\\to M$ broadcasting of mixed qubits, the situation is\nvery different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Dec 2006 07:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
