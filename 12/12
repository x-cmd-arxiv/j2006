Since the progenitors\nof long gamma-ray bursts have been identified as massive stars, this event\noffers a unique opportunity to investigate star formation environments at this\nepoch. Apart from its record redshift, the burst is remarkable in two respects:\nfirst, it exhibits fast-evolving X-ray and optical flares that peak\nsimultaneously at t~470 s in the observer frame, and may thus originate in the\nsame emission region; and second, its afterglow exhibits an accelerated decay\nin the near-infrared (NIR) from t~10^4 s to t~3 10^4 s after the burst,\ncoincident with repeated and energetic X-ray flaring activity. We make a\ncomplete analysis of available X-ray, NIR, and radio observations, utilizing\nafterglow models that incorporate a range of physical effects not previously\nconsidered for this or any other GRB afterglow, and quantifying our model\nuncertainties in detail via Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis. In the process,\nwe explore the possibility that the early optical and X-ray flare is due to\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton emission from the reverse shock regions of the\noutflow. We suggest that the period of accelerated decay in the NIR may be due\nto suppression of synchrotron radiation by inverse Compton interaction of X-ray\nflare photons with electrons in the forward shock; a subsequent interval of\nslow decay would then be due to a progressive decline in this suppression. The\nrange of acceptable models demonstrates that the kinetic energy and circumburst\ndensity of GRB 050904 are well above the typical values found for low-redshift\nGRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2006 19:28:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jun 2007 13:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

For natural\nchoices of these scales decays are unlikely, and, hence, the choice of the\nBunch-Davies vacuum as the state of the primordial perturbations does not\nappear to be warranted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Dec 2006 20:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

In order to account for the velocity\nfield, we propose the kinematical model where the warped rotating disk is also\nexpanding. The line ratio of CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) reveals that the eastern component\nwith the anomalous velocity gradient appears to be warmer and denser. This is\nconsistent with the gas in this component being closer to the center, being\nheated by the central activities, and possibly interacted by expanding motions\nfrom the nuclear region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2006 04:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Over the last decade enough theoretical and observational evidence\nhave accumulated to believe that many galactic globular clusters may host IMBHs\nin the centres, just like galaxies do. The well-established correlations for\nsupermassive black holes and their galaxies do suggest that, in extrapolation,\nglobular clusters (GCs) follow the same relations. Most of the attempts in\nsearch of the central black holes (BHs) are not direct and present enormous\nobservational difficulties due to the crowding of stars in the GC cores. Here\nwe propose a new method of detection of the central BH--the microlensing of the\ncluster stars by the central black hole. If the core of the cluster is\nresolved, the direct determination of the lensing curve and lensing system\nparameters is possible; if unresolved, the differential imaging technique (or\npixel lensing) can be applied. We calculate the optical depth to central BH\nmicrolensing for a selected list of Galactic globular clusters and estimate the\naverage time duration of the events.

In one form of a DDoS attack, a large number of compromised\nhosts send unwanted traffic to the victim, thus exhausting the resources of the\nvictim and preventing it from serving its legitimate clients. One of the main\nmechanisms that have been proposed to deal with DDoS is filtering, which allows\nrouters to selectively block unwanted traffic. Given the magnitude of DDoS\nattacks and the high cost of filters in the routers today, the successful\nmitigation of a DDoS attack using filtering crucially depends on the efficient\nallocation of filtering resources. In this paper, we consider a single router,\ntypically the gateway of the victim, with a limited number of available\nfilters. We study how to optimally allocate filters to attack sources, or\nentire domains of attack sources, so as to maximize the amount of good traffic\npreserved, under a constraint on the number of filters. We formulate the\nproblem as an optimization problem and solve it optimally using dynamic\nprogramming, study the properties of the optimal allocation, experiment with a\nsimple heuristic and evaluate our solutions for a range of realistic\nattack-scenarios.

We\ndescribe how to blow up such singularities, and then derive the moduli Kaehler\npotential for M-theory on the resulting class of G_2 manifolds. To consider the\nsingular limit it is necessary to derive the supergravity action for M-theory\non the orbifold C^2/Z_N.

The\ndisturbance is represented by a Fourier integral over all possible axial\nwavenumbers, and an integrodifferential equation for the amplitude-density\nfunction of a continuous spectrum is derived. The equations describing the\nevolution of monochromatic waves and slowly-varying wave-packets of classical\nweakly nonlinear instability theories are shown to be special limiting cases.\nNumerical integration of the integrodifferential equation shows that the final\nequilibrium state depends on the initial disturbance, as observed\nexperimentally, and it is not unique. The predicted range of wavenumbers for\nstable supercritical Taylor vortices is found to be narrower than the span of\nthe neutral curve from linear theory. Taylor-vortex flows with wavenumbers\noutside this range are found to be unstable and to decay, but to excite another\nwave inside the narrow band. This result is in agreement with the Eckhaus and\nBenjamin-Feir sideband instability. The presence of multiple solutions at a\nfixed Reynolds number for a given geometry in Taylor-Couette flows has been\nknown since Coles monumental contribution in 1965. It is worthwhile to note\nthat the existence of multiple solutions, found by Coles, differs from current\npopular bifurcation theories. The multiple solutions in Coles sense have also\nbeen found for mixed-convection flows (Yao & Ghosh Moulic 1993, 1994) besides\nthe Taylor-Couette flows.

In previous papers we proposed and used new\nnumerical methods to demonstrate the presence of the new resonances predicted\nby Ruelle in a model of chaotic neural network. In this article we deal with\nsimpler models which can be worked out analytically in order to gain more\ninsights into the genesis of the ``stable'' resonances and their consequences\non the linear response of the system. We consider a class of 2-dimensional\ntime-discrete maps describing simple rotator models with a contracting radial\ndynamics onto the unit circle and a chaotic angular dynamics $\\theta_{t+1} = 2\n\\theta_t (\\mod 2\\pi)$. A generalisation of this system to a network of\ninterconnected rotators is also analysed and related with our previous studies\n\\cite{CS1,CS2}. These models permit us to classify the different types of\nresonances in the susceptibility and to discuss in particular the relation\nbetween the relaxation time of the system to equilibrium with the {\\em mixing}\ntime given by the decay of the correlation functions. Also it enables one to\npropose some general mechanisms responsible for the creation of stable\nresonances with arbitrary frequencies, widths, and dependency on the pair of\nperturbed/observed variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2006 08:05:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The schemes are minimal,\ni.e. they involve a single additional probe qudit, and optimal, i.e. they\nprovide the maximum amount of information compatible with a given level of\ndisturbance. The performances of optimal single-user schemes in extracting\ninformation by sequential measurements in a N -user transmission line are also\ninvestigated, and the optimality is analyzed by explicit evaluation of\nfidelities. We found that the estimation fidelity does not depend on the number\nof users, neither for single-measure inference nor for collective one, whereas\nthe transmission fidelity decreases with N . The resulting trade-off is no\nlonger optimal and degrades with increasing N . We found that optimality can be\nrestored by an effective preparation of the probe states and present explicitly\ncalculations for the 2-user case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Dec 2006 14:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-08"}
