In our calculations, the electronic\nproblem and the local magnetic problem are solved separately. For the\nelectronic part an interpolating self-energy approach together with a coherent\npotential approximation (CPA) treatment of a dynamical alloy analogy is used to\ncalculate temperature-dependent quasiparticle densities of states and the\nelectronic self-energy of the diluted local-moment system.

The disorder of the localized moments in the effective\nHeisenberg model is solved by a generalized locator CPA approach.
