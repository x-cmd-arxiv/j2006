Conductivity spectra\nwere first measured at four temperatures below 10 K after having prepared the\ncrystal in the so called ortho-II phase in which the CuO chain oxygen are\nordered into alternating full and empty chains. These spectra exhibit features\nexpected for quasiparticle scattering from dilute weak impurities (small\nscattering phaseshift) in an otherwise clean d-wave superconductor. The\nmeasurements were repeated on the same crystal after heating and then rapidly\nquenching the sample to reduce the degree of oxygen order in the CuO chains.\nWith the increased disorder, the conductivity spectra retain the distinctive\nweak-limit scattering features, but have increased widths reflecting an\nincrease in quasiparticle scattering. These measurements unambiguously\nestablish that CuO chain oxygen disorder is the dominant source of in-plane\nquasiparticle scattering in high purity YBCO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2006 02:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

In the present paper we deal\nwith the so-called $f(R)$ gravity, whose action is a function of the curvature\nscalar $R$.

Our numerical results\ndiffer moderately from previous computations in the literature, and lead to an\nabsolute upper bound on the mixing angles of the dark matter sterile neutrino.\nComparing this bound with existing astrophysical X-ray constraints, we find\nthat the Dodelson-Widrow scenario, which proposes sterile neutrinos generated\nby active-sterile neutrino transitions to be the sole source of dark matter, is\nonly possible for sterile neutrino masses lighter than 3.5 keV (6 keV if all\nhadronic uncertainties are pushed in one direction and the most stringent X-ray\nbounds are relaxed by a factor of two). This upper bound may conflict with a\nlower bound from structure formation, but a definitive conclusion necessitates\nnumerical simulations with the non-equilibrium momentum distribution function\nthat we derive. If other production mechanisms are also operative, no upper\nbound on the sterile neutrino mass can be established.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2006 15:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 2007 08:39:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Jan 2015 08:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-12"}

We show that the coupling of a hypermultiplet into a theory\nwhose potential has a non-zero value at its critical point, and gauging a\ncompact subgroup of the hyperscalar isometry group will only rescale the value\nof the potential at the critical point by a positive factor, and therefore will\nnot change the nature of an existing critical point. However this is not the\ncase for non-compact SO(1,1) gaugings. An SO(1,1) gauging of the hyper isometry\nwill generally lead to deSitter vacua, which is analogous to the ground states\nfound by simultaneously gauging SO(1,1) symmetry of the real scalar manifold\nwith U(1)_R in earlier literature. SO(m,1) gaugings with m>1, which give\ncontributions to the scalar potential only in the Magical Jordan family\ntheories, on the other hand, do not lead to deSitter vacua. Anti-deSitter vacua\nare generically obtained when the U(1)_R symmetry is gauged. We also show that\nit is possible to embed certain generic Jordan family theories into the Magical\nJordan family preserving the nature of the ground states. However the Magical\nJordan family theories have additional ground states which are not found in the\ngeneric Jordan family theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Dec 2006 07:34:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
