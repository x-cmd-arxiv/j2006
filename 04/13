Following procedures introduced by Eyles et al. (2005), we estimate\nstellar masses for various sub-samples for which reliable and unconfused\nSpitzer IRAC detections are available. A spectroscopic sample of 14 of the most\nluminous sources with <z>=4.92 provides a firm lower limit to the stellar mass\ndensity of 1e6 Msun/Mpc^3. Several galaxies in this sub-sample have masses of\norder 10^11 Msun implying significant earlier activity occurred in massive\nsystems. We then consider a larger sample whose photometric redshifts in the\npublicly-available GOODS-MUSIC catalog lie in the range 4.4 <z 5.6. Before\nadopting the GOODS-MUSIC photometric redshifts, we check the accuracy of their\nphotometry and explore the possibility of contamination by low-z galaxies and\nlow-mass stars. After excising probable stellar contaminants and using the z'-J\ncolor to exclude any remaining foreground red galaxies, we conclude that 196\nsources are likely to be at z~5. The implied mass density from the unconfused\nIRAC fraction of this sample, scaled to the total available, is 6e6 Msun/Mpc^3.\nWe discuss the uncertainties as well as the likelihood that we have\nunderestimated the true mass density. Including fainter and quiescent sources\nthe total integrated density could be as high as 1e7 Msun/Mpc^3. Using the\ncurrently available (but highly uncertain) rate of decline in the star\nformationhistory over 5 <z< 10, a better fit is obtained for the assembled mass\nat z~5 if we admit significant dust extinction at early times or extend the\nluminosity function to very faint limits.

The phenomenon\nis discussed in many contexts in particle, nuclear and astro- physics but\ndirect tests of the Klein paradox using elementary particles have so far proved\nimpossible. Here we show that the effect can be tested in a conceptually simple\ncondensed-matter experiment by using electrostatic barriers in single- and\nbi-layer graphene. Due to the chiral nature of their quasiparticles, quantum\ntunneling in these materials becomes highly anisotropic, qualitatively\ndifferent from the case of normal, nonrelativistic electrons. Massless Dirac\nfermions in graphene allow a close realization of Klein's gedanken experiment\nwhereas massive chiral fermions in bilayer graphene offer an interesting\ncomplementary system that elucidates the basic physics involved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2006 16:55:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2006 09:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

On a slight random perturbation of an arbitrary linear\nprogram, the simplex method finds the solution after a walk on polytope(s) with\nexpected length polynomial in the number of constraints n, the number of\nvariables d and the inverse standard deviation of the perturbation 1/sigma.\n  We show that the length of walk in the simplex method is actually\npolylogarithmic in the number of constraints n.

This is justified by the\nnonlinear and nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. None of physical\nobservables/processes in low-energy QCD will be directly affected by such a\ntemporary violation of color gauge invariance/symmetry. No\ntruncations/approximations and no special gauge are made for the regularized\nskeleton loop integrals, contributing to the full gluon self-energy, which\nenters the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the full gluon propagator. In order to\nmake the existence of a mass gap perfectly clear the corresponding subtraction\nprocedure is introduced. All this allows one to establish the general structure\nof the full gluon propagator and the gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation in the\npresence of a mass gap. It is mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction of\nmassless gluon modes. The physical meaning of the mass gap is to be responsible\nfor the large-scale (low-energy/momentum), i.e., nonperturbative structure of\nthe true QCD vacuum. In the presence of a mass gap two different types of\nsolutions for the full gluon propagator are possible. The massive solution\nleads to an affective gluon mass, which depends on the gauge-fixing parameter\nexplicitly. This solution becomes smooth at small gluon momentum in the Landau\ngauge.

We show that there is considerable\ncorrelation between the probe intensities across the array which defy the\nindependence assumption.

The notion of streams of\nconsciousness, usually restricted to conscious beings, is extended to the\nnotion of a Universal/Global stream of conscious flow of ordered events. The\nstreams of conscious events which we experience constitute sub-streams of the\nUniversal stream. Our postulated ontological character of consciousness also\nconsists of an operator which acts on a state of potential consciousness to\ncreate or modify the likelihoods for later events to occur and become part of\nthe Universal conscious flow. A generalized process of measurement-perception\nis introduced, where the operation of consciousness brings into existence, from\na state of potentiality, the event in consciousness. This is mathematically\nrepresented by (a) an operator acting on the state of potential-consciousness\nbefore an actual event arises in consciousness and (b) the reflecting of the\nresult of this operation back onto the state of potential-consciousness for\ncomparison in order for the event to arise in consciousness. Beginning from our\npostulated ontology that consciousness is primary and from the most elementary\nconscious contents, such as perception of periodic change and motion, quantum\ntheory follows naturally as the description of the conscious experience.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2006 14:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
