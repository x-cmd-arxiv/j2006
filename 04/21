Previous\nattempts to explain the high redshift of reionization inferred from the WMAP 1\nyear data have led to widespread speculation that the sources of reionization\nmust have been much more efficient than those associated with the star\nformation observed at low redshift. This is consistent, for example, with the\nsuggestion that early star formation involved massive, Population III stars\nthat early on produced most of the ionizing radiation escaping from halos. It\nis therefore tempting to interpret the new WMAP results as implying that we can\nnow relax those previous high demands on the efficiency of the sources of\nreionization and perhaps even turn the argument around as evidence against such\nhigh efficiency.

At small\nscales (below ~2 arcmin) the excess of the soft flux is interpreted as the\ngenuine emission from halos of the WHIM surrounding individual galaxies. Bulk\nparameters of the average WHIM halos associated with galaxies in the sample are\nestimated. Typical halo has a characteristic radius of ~0.3 Mpc and a mass of 4\n- 7 x 10^11 M_sun. The average density of the WHIM in the local universe\namounts to 7 - 11 x 10^{-32} g cm^{-3} (Omega_WHIM = 0.7 - 1.2 %). Observations\nof the X-ray WHIM emission are in good agreement with the numerical\nsimulations, but accuracy of the observational material is insufficient to\nconstrain the theory of WHIM. A series of deep observations of a moderately\nnumerous sample of low redshift galaxies with high resolution instruments of\nChandra would significantly improve our estimates of the WHIM parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2006 12:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This method has already been used to successfully\nanalyze the vibrational modes in various molecular systems and offers a new\nperspective on the dynamics in many particle bosonic systems. We discuss a\nsystem consisting of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a triple well potential.\nSuch systems correspond to classical Hamiltonian systems with three degrees of\nfreedom. The semiclassical approach allows a simple visualization of the\neigenstates of the quantum system referring to the underlying classical\ndynamics. From this classification we can read off the dynamical properties of\nthe eigenstates such as particle exchange between the wells and entanglement\nwithout further calculations. In addition, this approach offers new insights\ninto the validity of the mean-field description of the many particle system by\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation, since we make use of exactly this correspondence\nin our semiclassical analysis. We choose a three mode system in order to\nvisualize it easily and, moreover, to have a sufficiently interesting\nstructure, although the method can also be extended to higher dimensional\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Apr 2006 21:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2006 21:13:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
