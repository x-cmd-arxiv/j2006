The z = 0.06807 absorber is notable for\nseveral reasons. The absorption profiles reveal simple kinematics indicative of\nquiescent material.

The\nLarge Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey\ncover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of K~18; the Deep\nExtragalactic Survey covers 35 square degrees to K~21, and the Ultra Deep\nSurvey covers 0.77 square degrees to K~23.

The prime aim of UKIDSS is to\nprovide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however driven\nby a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintest\nsub-stellar objects; to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist; to\ndetermine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; to\ndetermine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure from\nz=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and to\nmap the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being\nuniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive\n(WSA : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and\nthe UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small\nscience verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera.\nWe show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely\npower of the eventual complete survey.

Saturation length and power versus energy chirp parameter are\ncalculated numerically. It is shown that the effect of linear energy chirp on\nFEL gain is equivalent to the linear undulator tapering (or linear energy\nvariation along the undulator). A consequence of this fact is a possibility to\nperfectly compensate FEL gain degradation, caused by the energy chirp, by means\nof the undulator tapering independently of the value of the energy chirp\nparameter. An application of this effect for generation of attosecond pulses\nfrom a hard X-ray FEL is proposed.
