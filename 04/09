When the initial distribution takes only\ntwo values, the Lynden-Bell distribution is similar to the Fermi-Dirac\nstatistics. Such distributions have recently been observed in direct numerical\nsimulations of the HMF model (Antoniazzi et al. 2006). In this paper, we\ndetermine the caloric curve corresponding to the Lynden-Bell statistics in\nrelation with the HMF model and analyze the dynamical and thermodynamical\nstability of spatially homogeneous solutions by using two general criteria\npreviously introduced in the literature. We express the critical energy and the\ncritical temperature as a function of a degeneracy parameter fixed by the\ninitial condition. Below these critical values, the homogeneous Lynden-Bell\ndistribution is not a maximum entropy state but an unstable saddle point. We\napply these results to the situation considered by Antoniazzi et al.

For an energy U=0.69, this transition\noccurs above an initial magnetization M_{x}=0.897. In that case, the system\nshould reach an inhomogeneous Lynden-Bell distribution (most mixed) or an\nincompletely mixed state (possibly fitted by a Tsallis distribution).

The influx of mutations is accounted for by imposing a\nsuitable boundary condition. For a Wright-Fisher diffusion with or without\nselection and varying population size, the boundary condition is $\\lim_{x\n\\downarrow 0} x f(x,t)=\\theta \\rho(t)$, where $f(\\cdot,t)$ is the frequency\nspectrum of derived alleles at independent loci at time $t$ and $\\rho(t)$ is\nthe relative population size at time $t$. When population size and selection\nintensity are independent of time, the forward equation is equivalent to the\nbackwards diffusion usually used to derive the frequency spectrum, but the\nforward equation allows computation of the time dependence of the spectrum both\nbefore an equilibrium is attained and when population size and selection\nintensity vary with time. From the diffusion equation, we derive a set of\nordinary differential equations for the moments of $f(\\cdot,t)$ and express the\nexpected spectrum of a finite sample in terms of those moments. We illustrate\nthe use of the forward equation by considering neutral and selected alleles in\na highly simplified model of human history. For example, we show that\napproximately 30% of the expected heterozygosity of neutral loci is\nattributable to mutations that arose since the onset of population growth in\nroughly the last $150,000$ years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Apr 2006 16:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2006 17:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We interpreted the two leading models of voltage-gating with respect\nto the thermodynamic energetics of membrane insertion of the voltage-sensing\n'module' from a comprehensive set of potassium channels. KvAP is an archaeal\nvoltage-gated potassium channel whose x-ray structure was the basis for\ndetermining the general mechanism of voltage-gating. The free energy of\nmembrane insertion of the KvAP voltage sensor was revealed to be a single\noutlier. This was due to its unusual sequence that facilitated large gating\nmovements in its native lipid membrane. This degree of free energy was the\nleast typical of the other voltage sensors, including the Shaker potassium\nchannel. We inferred that the two leading models of voltage-gating referred to\nalternative mechanisms of voltage-gating: each is applicable to an independent\nset of ion channels. The large motion of the voltage-sensor during gating\nproposed by the KvAP-paddle model of gating is unlikely to be mirrored by the\nmajority of ion channels whose voltage sensors are not located at the\nmembrane-cytoplasm interface in the channel closed state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2006 07:19:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 06:44:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Sep 2007 07:04:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 28 Sep 2007 10:34:22 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 20 Apr 2011 07:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-21"}
