When sources are appended to all the field equations, from the\nlatter and from the contracted Bianchi identities a sort of\ngravoelectrodynamics appears, that totally departs from the so called\nEinstein-Maxwell theory, since its constitutive equation, that rules the link\nbetween inductions and fields, is a very complicated differential relation that\nallows for a much wider, still practically unexplored range of possible\noccurrences. In this sort of theory one can allow for both an electric and a\nmagnetic four-current, which are not a physically wrong replica of each other,\nlike it would occur if both these currents were allowed in Maxwell's vacuum.\nParticular static exact solutions show that, due to the peculiar constitutive\nequation, while electric charges with a pole structure behave according to\nCoulomb's law, magnetic charges with a pole structure interact with forces not\ndepending on their mutual distance. The latter behaviour was already discovered\nby Treder in 1957 with an approximate calculation, while looking for ordinary\nelectromagnetism in the theory. He also showed that in the Hermitian theory\nmagnetic charges of unlike sign mutually attract, hence they are permanently\nconfined entities. The exact solutions confirm this finding, already\ninterpreted in 1980 by Treder in a chromodynamic sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2006 15:12:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Jul 2012 15:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-19"}

Experimental data of different tumors have been shown to\ncorrespond to all these tumor-growth laws. Recently reported studies suggest\nthe existence of tumors that follow a power law behavior. Our model is able to\nfit also these data for q<1. We show that for q<1, the commonly used\nconstant-intensity therapy is unable to reduce the tumor size to zero. As is\nthe case of the Gompertzian tumors, for- q<1 a late-intesification schedule is\nneeded. However, these tumors with q<1 are even harder to cure than the\nGompertzian ones. While for a Gompertzian tumor a linearly-increasing cell-kill\nfunction is enough to reduce the tumor size to zero following an exponential\ndecay, in the case of tumors with q<1, the exponential decay is obtained only\nwith an exponentially increasing cell-kill function. This means that these\ntumors would need an even more aggressive treatment schedule. We have shown\nthat for Gompertzian tumors a logarithmic late-intensification is sufficient\nfor the asymptotic reduction of the tumor-size to zero. This is not the fastest\nway but it is more tolerable for patients.

Usually, a quantum algorithm must be mapped into a quantum\ncircuit. Optimal synthesis of quantum circuits is intractable and heuristic\nmethods must be employed. With the use of heuristics, the optimality of\ncircuits is no longer guaranteed. In this paper, we consider a local\noptimization technique based on templates to simplify and reduce the depth of\nnon-optimal quantum circuits. We present and analyze templates in the general\ncase, and provide particular details for the circuits composed of NOT, CNOT and\ncontrolled-sqrt-of-NOT gates. We apply templates to optimize various common\ncircuits implementing multiple control Toffoli gates and quantum Boolean\narithmetic circuits. We also show how templates can be used to compact the\nnumber of levels of a quantum circuit. The runtime of our implementation is\nsmall while the reduction in number of quantum gates and number of levels is\nsignificant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Apr 2006 01:09:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Feb 2008 17:33:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-27"}
