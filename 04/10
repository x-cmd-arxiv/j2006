The origin of these high\nmagnetic fields is uncertain, but a popular hypothesis is that magnetars are\nborn with an initial spin period not much exceeding the convective overturn\ntime (~3ms), which results in a powerful dynamo action, amplifying the seed\nmagnetic field to $> ~10^{15}$ G. Part of this rotation energy is then expected\nto power the supernova through rapid magnetic braking. It is therefore possible\nthat magnetars creation is accompanied by supernovae that are an order of\nmagnitude more energetic than normal supernovae, provided their initial spin\nperiod is ~1 ms. However, we list here evidence that the explosion energies of\nthese supernova remnants associated with AXPs and SGRs -- Kes 73 (AXP 1E\n1841-045), CTB 109 (AXP 1E2259+586) and N49 (SGR 0526-66) -- are close to the\ncanonical supernova explosion energy of $10^{51}$~erg, suggesting an initial\nspin period of > ~5ms.\n  We therefore do not find evidence that magnetars are formed from rapidly\nrotating proto-neutron stars, allowing for the possibility that they descend\nfrom stellar progenitor with high magnetic field cores, and we discuss the\nmerits of both formation scenarios.\n  In an appendix we describe the analysis of XMM-Newton observations of Kes 73\nand N49 used to derive the explosion energies for these remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Apr 2006 20:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 May 2006 22:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We first construct a mean-field Luttinger-Ward\nthermodynamic functional in terms of the condensate wave function $\\Psi$ and\nthe Nambu Green's function $\\hat{G}$ for the quasiparticle field. Imposing its\nstationarity respect to $\\Psi$ and $\\hat{G}$ yields a set of equations to\ndetermine the equilibrium for general non-uniform systems. They have a\nplausible property of satisfying the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem to provide a\ngapless excitation spectrum. Also, the corresponding dynamical equations of\nmotion obey various conservation laws. Thus, the present mean-field theory\nshares two important properties with the exact theory: ``conserving'' and\n``gapless.'' The theory is then applied to a homogeneous weakly interacting\nBose gas with s-wave scattering length $a$ and particle mass $m$ to clarify its\nbasic thermodynamic properties under two complementary conditions of constant\ndensity $n$ and constant pressure $p$. The superfluid transition is predicted\nto be first-order because of the non-analytic nature of the order-parameter\nexpansion near $T_{c}$ inherent in Bose systems, i.e., the Landau-Ginzburg\nexpansion is not possible here.

After an increase in galactose\nconcentration, galactose molecules bind onto Gal3p. This event leads via Gal80p\nto the activation of Gal4p, which then induces GAL3 and GAL80 gene\ntranscription. Here we propose a qualitative dynamic model, whereby these\nmolecular interaction events represent the first two stages of a functional\nfeedback loop that closes with the capture of activated Gal4p by newly\nsynthesized Gal3p and Gal80p, decreasing transcriptional activation and\ncreating again the protein complex that can bind incoming galactose molecules.\nBased on the differential time scales of faster protein interactions versus\nslower biosynthetic steps, this feedback loop functions as a derivative filter\nwhere galactose is the input step signal, and released Gal4p is the output\nderivative signal. One advantage of such a derivative filter is that GAL genes\nare expressed in proportion to the cellular requirement. Furthermore, this\nfilter adaptively protects the cellular receptors from saturation by galactose,\nallowing cells to remain sensitive to variations in galactose concentrations\nrather than to absolute concentrations. Finally, this feedback loop, by\nallowing phosphorylation of some active Gal4p, may be essential to initiate the\nsubsequent long-term response.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2006 11:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We prove three results about\nthis question. First, we give a \"quantum oracle separation\" between QMA and\nQCMA. More concretely, we show that any quantum algorithm needs\n$\\Omega(\\sqrt{2^n/(m+1)})$ queries to find an $n$-qubit \"marked state\"\n$\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$, even if given an $m$-bit classical description of\n$\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$ together with a quantum black box that recognizes\n$\\lvert\\psi\\rangle$. Second, we give an explicit QCMA protocol that nearly\nachieves this lower bound. Third, we show that, in the one previously-known\ncase where quantum proofs seemed to provide an exponential advantage, classical\nproofs are basically just as powerful. In particular, Watrous gave a QMA\nprotocol for verifying non-membership in finite groups. Under plausible\ngroup-theoretic assumptions, we give a QCMA protocol for the same problem. Even\nwith no assumptions, our protocol makes only polynomially many queries to the\ngroup oracle. We end with some conjectures about quantum versus classical\noracles, and about the possibility of a classical oracle separation between QMA\nand QCMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2006 02:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2006 17:33:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2006 18:21:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 21:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}
