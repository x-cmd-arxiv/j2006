Accreting gas does not\ntravel at the global virial velocity of the system due to the\nvelocity-sizescale relation inherent in turbulent gas and due to the lower\nvelocity dispersion of small-N clusters in which much of the accretion occurs.\nStars located in the gas-rich centres of such systems initially accrete from\nlow relative velocity gas attaining larger masses before needing to accrete the\nhigher velocity gas. Stars not in the centres of such potentials, or that enter\nthe cluster later when the velocity dispersion is higher, do not accrete\nsignificantly and thus retain their low-masses. In competitive accretion, most\nstars do not continue to accrete significantly such that their masses are set\nfrom the fragmentation process. It is the few stars which continue to accrete\nthat become higher-mass stars. Competitive accretion is therefore likely to be\nresponsible for the formation of higher-mass stars and can explain the mass\ndistribution, mass segregation and binary frequency of these stars.

Although highly simplified, the model reproduces all of the bursting\nregimes seen in the more complete global linear stability analysis of Narayan &\nHeyl (2003), including the regime of delayed mixed bursts. The results are also\nconsistent with observations of type I X-ray bursts. At accretion rates Mdot <\n0.1 Mdot_Edd, thermonuclear He burning via the well-known thin-shell thermal\ninstability triggers bursts. As Mdot increases, however, the trigger mechanism\nevolves from the fast thermal instability to a slowly growing overstability\ninvolving both H and He burning. The competition between nuclear heating via\nthe beta-limited CNO cycle and the triple-alpha process on the one hand, and\nradiative cooling via photon diffusion and emission on the other hand, drives\noscillations with a period approximately equal to the H-burning timescale. If\nthese oscillations grow, the gradually rising temperature at the base of the\nhelium layer eventually provokes a thin-shell thermal instability and hence a\ndelayed mixed burst. For Mdot > 0.25 Mdot_Edd, there is no instability or\noverstability, and there are no bursts. Nearly all other theoretical models\npredict that bursts should occur for all Mdot < Mdot_Edd, in conflict with both\nour results and observations.

We test the consistency of the new results with previous constraints on\ncosmological parameters from the HIFLUGCS galaxy cluster sample and the impact\nof this shift on the X-ray luminosity-gravitational mass relation. The measured\nX-ray luminosity function combined with the observed luminosity-mass relation\nare compared to mass functions predicted for given cosmological parameter\nvalues. The luminosity function and luminosity-mass relation derived previously\nfrom HIFLUGCS are in perfect agreement with mass functions predicted using the\nbest fit parameter values from the 3rd year WMAP data (OmegaM=0.238,\nsigma8=0.74) and inconsistent with the concordance cosmological model\n(OmegaM=0.3, sigma8=0.9), assuming a flat Universe. Trying to force consistency\nwith the concordance model requires artificially decreasing the normalization\nof the luminosity-mass relation by a factor of 2. The shift in best fit values\nfor OmegaM and sigma8 has a significant impact on predictions of cluster\nabundances. The new WMAP results are now in perfect agreement with previous\nresults on the OmegaM-sigma8 relation determined from the mass function of\nHIFLUGCS clusters and other X-ray cluster samples (the ``low cluster\nnormalization''). We conclude that - unless the true values of OmegaM and\nsigma8 differ significantly from the 3rd year WMAP results - the\nluminosity-mass relation is well described by their previous determination from\nX-ray observations of clusters, with a conservative upper limit on the bias\nfactor of 1.5. These conclusions are currently being tested in a complete\nfollow-up program of all HIFLUGCS clusters with Chandra and XMM-Newton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2006 12:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 May 2006 09:23:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The wave functions are strongly localized in\nthis well which leads to the increase of the electron density near the edges.\nBecause of the presence of this well, the subbands start to depopulate from the\ncentral region of the wire and remain pinned in the well region until they are\neventually pushed up by increasing magnetic field. We also demonstrate that the\nspin polarization of electron density as a function of magnetic field shows a\npronounced double-loop pattern that can be related to the successive\ndepopulation of the magnetosubbands. In contrast to the case of a smooth\nconfinement, in hard-wall wires the compressible strips do not form in the\nvicinity of wire boundaries and spatial spin separation between spin-up and\nspin-down states near edges is absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Apr 2006 00:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
