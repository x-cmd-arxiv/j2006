If it is assumed that both the optical and X-ray afterglows\narise from the same outflow then, in the framework of the standard forward\nshock model, the chromaticity of the X-ray light-curve breaks indicates that\nthey do not arise solely from a mechanism related to the outflow dynamics (e.g.\nenergy injection) or the angular distribution of the blast-wave kinetic energy\n(structured outflows or jets). The lack of a spectral evolution accompanying\nthe X-ray light-curve breaks shows that these breaks do not arise from the\npassage of a spectral break (e.g. the cooling frequency) either. Under these\ncircumstances, the decoupling of the X-ray and optical decays requires that the\nmicrophysical parameters for the electron and magnetic energies in the forward\nshock evolve in time, whether the X-ray afterglow is synchrotron or\ninverse-Compton emission.

Models that do provide\nthe necessary angular momentum are discussed, with emphasis on a new single\nstar model whose rapid rotation leads to complete mixing on the main sequence\nand avoids red giant formation. This channel of progenitor evolution also gives\na broader range of masses than previous models, and allows the copious\nproduction of bursts outside of binaries and at high redshifts.

This suggests that\nbursts at high redshift (low metallicity) will, on the average, be more\nenergetic, have more time structure, and last longer than bursts nearby. Every\nburst consists of three components: a polar jet (~0.1 radian), high energy,\nsubrelativistic mass ejection (~1 radian), and low velocity equatorial mass\nthat can fall back after the initial explosion. The relative proportions of\nthese three components can give a diverse assortment of supernovae and high\nenergy transients whose properties may vary with redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2006 13:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-11"}

A\nlarge network latency affects all aspects of data communication in a WANET,\nincluding an increase in delay, packet loss, required processing power and\nmemory. We consider network management and data routing challenges in WANETs\nwith scalable network latency. On the physical side, reducing network latency\nimposes a significantly higher power and bandwidth demand on nodes, as is\nreflected in a set of new bounds. On the protocol front, designing distributed\nrouting protocols that can guarantee the delivery of data packets within\nscalable number of hops is a challenging task. To solve this, we introduce\nmulti-resolution randomized hierarchy (MRRH), a novel power and bandwidth\nefficient WANET protocol with scalable network latency. MRRH uses a randomized\nalgorithm for building and maintaining a random hierarchical network topology,\nwhich together with the proposed routing algorithm can guarantee efficient\ndelivery of data packets in the wireless network.

Our goal is to characterize\nthe families of planar shapes that admit locked chains, where some\nconfigurations cannot be reached by continuous reconfiguration without\nself-intersection, and which families of planar shapes guarantee universal\nfoldability, where every chain is guaranteed to have a connected configuration\nspace. Previously, only obtuse triangles were known to admit locked shapes, and\nonly line segments were known to guarantee universal foldability. We show that\na surprisingly general family of planar shapes, called slender adornments,\nguarantees universal foldability: roughly, the distance from each edge along\nthe path along the boundary of the slender adornment to each hinge should be\nmonotone. In contrast, we show that isosceles triangles with any desired apex\nangle less than 90 degrees admit locked chains, which is precisely the\nthreshold beyond which the inward-normal property no longer holds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2006 14:46:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2006 10:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 May 2010 18:23:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 17 May 2010 17:20:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-02-18"}

A phenomenon of ``freezing of\ncoherence'' is a result of a competition between longitudinal dispersion and\nthe separation of wave-packets of propagating modes in the medium.

The method is based on a heat-and-pull rig, whereby a CO2\nlaser is continuously scanned across a length of fiber that is being pulled\nsynchronously. Our system relies on a CO2 mirror mounted on a geared stepper\nmotor in order to scan the laser beam across the taper region. We show that\nthis system offers a reliable alternative to more traditional rigs\nincorporating galvanometer scanners. We have routinely obtained transmission\nlosses between 0.1 and 0.3 dB indicating the satisfactory production of\nadiabatic tapers. The operation of the rig is described in detail and an\nanalysis on the produced tapers is provided. The flexibility of the rig is\ndemonstrated by fabricating prolate dielectric microresonators using a\nmicrotapering technique. Such a rig is of interest to a range of fields that\nrequire tapered fiber fabrication such as microcavity-taper coupling, atom\nguiding along a tapered fiber, optical fiber sensing and the fabrication of\nfused biconical tapered couplers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2006 15:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2006 16:10:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Feb 2007 17:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
