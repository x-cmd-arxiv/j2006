The association is identified using radial velocity measurements of\nsample objects selected from the Herbig and Bell Catalog based on their spatial\nproximity to AS 353. Radial velocities of nine objects were measured from\nmulti-epoch high-resolution (R~30,000) H-band spectra obtained with NIRSPEC on\nKeck II. High-resolution K-band spectra were also obtained for most of the\nsample objects. Spectral types and rotational velocities are determined for all\nobjects in the sample. The multi-epoch H-band spectra were examined for radial\nvelocity variations in order to detect possible spectroscopic binaries. Eight\nof the nine objects have radial velocities that are consistent within the\n1-sigma scatter of the sample. From their mean of -8.6 km/s these eight objects\nhave a standard deviation of 2 km/s, which suggests that the sample stars are\nrelated. The ninth object shows significant radial velocity variations between\nepochs, characteristic of a spectroscopic binary. The overall multiplicity of\nthe sample is high; we observed 13 stars in seven systems, identifying three\nnew candidate binary components in this project. Many of the spectra reveal\nhydrogen emission lines typical of strong accretion processes, indicating that\nmost of these objects harbor circumstellar disks and are less than a few\nmillion years old. We discuss possible interpretations of the enigmatic pure\nemission line spectrum of HBC 684. This work represents the highest spectral\nresolution infrared observations to date of these intriguing, nearby young\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2006 16:45:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The corresponding distortion of the NiO2 planes is\nfound to dictate the direction of the charge stripes, similar to the case of\ndiagonal spin stripes in the insulating phase of La2-xSrxCuO4. In particular,\ndiagonal stripes seem to always run along the short a-axis, which is the\ndirection of the octahedral tilt axis. In contrast, no influence of the crystal\nsymmetry on the charge stripe ordering temperature itself was observed, with\nT_CO 240K for La, Pr, and Nd. The coupling between lattice and stripe degrees\nof freedom allows one to produce macroscopic samples with unidirectional stripe\norder. In samples with stoichiometric oxygen content and a hole concentration\nof exactly 1/3, charge stripes exhibit a staggered stacking order with a period\nof three NiO2 layers, previously only observed with electron microscopy in\ndomains of mesoscopic dimensions. Remarkably, this stacking order starts to\nmelt about 40K below T_CO.

In 1964, Roth proved that if each\ninteger from 0 to N is coloured red or blue, there is some arithmetic\nprogression in which the number of reds and the number of blues differ by at\nleast (1/20) N^{1/4}. In 1996, Matousek and Spencer showed that this estimate\nis sharp up to a constant. The analogous question for homogeneous arithmetic\nprogressions (i.e., the ones containing 0) was raised by Erdos in the 1930s,\nand it is still not known whether the discrepancy is unbounded. However, it is\neasy to construct partial colourings with density arbitrarily close to 1 such\nthat all homogeneous arithmetic progressions have bounded discrepancy.\n  A related problem concerns the discrepancy of quasi-progressions. A\nquasi-progression consists of successive multiples of a real number, with each\nmultiple rounded down to the nearest integer. In 1986, Beck showed that given\nany 2-colouring, the quasi-progressions corresponding to almost all real\nnumbers in (1, \\infty) have discrepancy at least log* N, the inverse of the\ntower function. We improve the lower bound to (log N)^{1/4 - o(1)}, and also\nshow that there is some quasi-progression with discrepancy at least (1/50)\nN^{1/6}.

A motif that occurs very often at this\ninterface is a negative feedback loop used to regulate the level of the signal\nmolecules. In this work we use mathematical models to investigate the steady\nstate and dynamical behaviour of different negative feedback loops. We show, in\nparticular, that feedback loops where the signal molecule does not cause the\ndissociation of the transcription factor from the DNA respond faster than loops\nwhere the molecule acts by sequestering transcription factors off the DNA. We\nuse three examples, the bet, mer and lac systems in E. coli, to illustrate the\nbehaviour of such feedback loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2006 16:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is assumed that the space of coexistence is\nexplicitly subdivided in a grid of cells. Each cell can be occupied by only one\nindividual of each species or can be empty. The system evolves in time\naccording to a probabilistic cellular automaton composed by a set of local\nrules which describe interactions between species individuals and mimic the\nprocess of birth, death and predation. By performing computational simulations,\nwe found that, depending on the values of the parameters of the model, the\nfollowing states can be reached: a prey absorbing state and active states of\ntwo types. In one of them both species coexist in a stationary regime with\npopulation densities constant in time. The other kind of active state is\ncharacterized by local coupled time oscillations of prey and predator\npopulations. We focus on the self-organized structures arising from\nspatio-temporal dynamics of the coexistence. We identify distinct spatial\npatterns of prey and predators and verify that they are intimally connected to\nthe time coexistence behavior of the species. The occurrence of a prey\npercolating cluster on the spatial patterns of the active states is also\nexamined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2006 22:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
