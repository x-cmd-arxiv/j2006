The energy released by an accreting Black Hole (BH) may be injected\ninto the ISM through blast waves arising directly from the central engine,\nradiation pressure or radiative heating. A scenario is described in which\nradiative heating perturbs the methabolism of a star-forming spheroid, leading\nto a critical stage where SNe form a cold expanding shell, pushed out of the\ngalaxy by radiation pressure from the AGN. This mechanism can regulate the\nBH--bulge relation to the observed value. However, this relation may be simply\nimprinted by the mechanism responsible for the nearly complete loss of angular\nmomentum of the gas that accretes onto the BH. Using a novel model of galaxy\nformation that includes AGNs, we show that models without self-regulation have\nproblems in reproducing the correct slope of the AGN luminosity function, while\nmodels with winds give a much better fit; however, all these models are almost\nindistingishable as far as their predicted BH--bulge relation is concerned.\nFinally, we show that the downsizing of the faint AGNs is most likely due to\nkinetic feedback in star-forming bulges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 16:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One proposed solution, for the case of PG 0014+067 in particular,\nassigns some modes with high degree (l=3).

Because\nthe nature of optically-selected quasar surveys makes them vulnerable to dust\nobscuration, we have undertaken a radio-selected quasar survey for damped Lya\nsystems to address this bias. We present the definition and results of this\nsurvey. We then combine our sample with the CORALS dataset to investigate the\nHI column density distribution function f(N) of damped Lya systems toward\nradio-selected quasars.

This power-law is in\nexcellent agreement with that of optically-selected samples at low N(HI), an\nimportant yet expected result given that obscuration should have negligible\neffect at these gas columns. However, because of the relatively small size of\nthe radio-selected sample, 26 damped Lya systems in 119 quasars, f(N) is not\nwell constrained at large N(HI) and the first moment of the HI distribution\nfunction, Omega_g, is, strictly speaking, a lower limit. The power-law is steep\nenough, however, that extrapolating it to higher column densities implies only\na modest, logarithmic increase in Omega_g. The radio-selected value of Omega_g\n= 1.15 x 10^-3, agrees well with the results of optically-selected surveys.\nWhile our results indicate that dust obscuration is likely not a major issue\nfor surveys of damped Lya systems, we estimate that a radio-selected sample of\napproximately 100 damped Lya systems will be required to obtain the precision\nnecessary to absolutely confirm an absence of dust bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 19:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here, Takeuti's formulation is extended to construct a model of set\ntheory based on the logic represented by the lattice of projections in an\narbitrary von Neumann algebra. A transfer principle is established that enables\nus to transfer theorems of ZFC to their quantum counterparts holding in the\nmodel. The set of real numbers in the model is shown to be in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the set of self-adjoint operators affiliated with the von\nNeumann algebra generated by the logic. Despite the difficulty pointed out by\nTakeuti that equality axioms do not generally hold in quantum set theory, it is\nshown that equality axioms hold for any real numbers in the model. It is also\nshown that any observational proposition in quantum mechanics can be\nrepresented by a corresponding statement for real numbers in the model with the\ntruth value consistent with the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, and\nthat the equality relation between two real numbers in the model is equivalent\nwith the notion of perfect correlation between corresponding observables\n(self-adjoint operators) in quantum mechanics. The paper is concluded with some\nremarks on the relevance to quantum set theory of the choice of the implication\nconnective in quantum logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Apr 2006 11:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2006 09:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-09-25"}
