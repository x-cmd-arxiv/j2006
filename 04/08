A sufficient quartic interaction for our Higgs boson arises from the\nusual gauge contribution together with a radiative contribution from a heavy\ntop squark.

We obtain reduced-row-echelon-form,\nR, for this matrix containing only one unknown, namely, the objective function\nitself as an unknown parameter, d, say. This matrix in the\nreduced-row-echelon-form contains columns (column vectors) corresponding to\nbasic variables and non-basic variables.

Here, we shall consider smooth, i.e. $C^\\infty$,\none-parameter families of dissipative, meaning non-conservative, surface\ndiffeomorphisms. An hetereoclinic cycle may appear when the parameter evolves\nand an orbit of tangency, say quadratic, is created between stable and unstable\nmanifolds (lines) of periodic orbits that belong to a basic hyperbolic set. The\nkey novelty is to allow this basic set, a horseshoe, to have Hausdorff\ndimension bigger than one. In the present paper we do assume such a dimension\nto be beyond one, but in a limited way, as explicitly indicated in the\nIntroduction. [A mild non-degeneracy condition on the family of maps is\nassumed: at the orbit of tangency the invariant lines, stable and unstable,\ncross each other with positive relative speed]. We then prove that most\ndiffeomorphisms, corresponding to parameter values near the bifurcating one,\nare non-uniformly hyperbolic in a neighborhood of the horseshoe and the orbit\nof tangency; such diffeomorphisms display no attractors nor repellors in such a\nneighborhood. A first precise formulation of our main theorem is at the\nIntroduction and a more encompassing version at the end of the paper.
