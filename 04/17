All three had faint and red\ncounterparts, the brightest of which was identified with an M star. However,\nthe remaining two showed hints of an extragalactic origin, one had a spatially\nextended counterpart and the other appeared in projection on the outskirts of a\nbright elliptical galaxy. If these two sources were really of an extragalactic\norigin then the two events represent a new class of exotic explosive\ntransients.

There is a prominent redward asymmetry in the 6.4 keV line, which\ncould indicate emission from a Compton shoulder.

A\nlow-inclination, moderately-relativistic dual-diskline model is possible if the\ncontribution from narrow components, due to distant material, is small or\nabsent.
