Interaction\nof the colliding clouds produces large-scale shear motions which are\nsuperimposed on small-scale turbulence. Generation of the large-scale magnetic\nfield is due to a ''shear-current\" effect (or \"vorticity-current\" effect), and\nthe mean vorticity is caused by the large-scale shear motions of colliding\nclouds. This effect causes the generation of the mean magnetic field even in a\nnonrotating and nonhelical homogeneous turbulence. There is no quenching of the\nnonlinear shear-current effect contrary to the quenching of the nonlinear alpha\neffect, the nonlinear turbulent magnetic diffusion, etc. During the nonlinear\ngrowth of the mean magnetic field, the shear-current effect only changes its\nsign at some value of the mean magnetic field which determines the level of the\nsaturated mean magnetic field. Numerical study shows that the saturated level\nof the mean magnetic field is of the order of the equipartition field\ndetermined by the turbulent kinetic energy.

For\ninterchain couplings, we use electron-electron interactions previously\nestimated for TTF-CA (TTF=tetrathiafulvalene, CA=chloranil). Photoexcitation is\nintroduced by a pulse of oscillating electric field. The time-dependent\nHartree-Fock approximation is used for the electronic part, and the classical\napproximation for the lattice part. In the ionic-to-neutral transition, the\ntransferred charge density is a strongly nonlinear function of the\nphotoexcitation density, which is characterized by the presence of a threshold.\nWith substantial interchain couplings comparable to those in TTF-CA, the\ninterchain correlation is strong during the transition. Neutral domains in\nnearby chains simultaneously grow even if their nucleation is delayed by\nreducing the amplitude of the electric field. With weaker interchain couplings,\nthe growing processes are in phase only when the amplitude of the electric\nfield is large. Thus, the experimentally observed, coherent motion of a\nmacroscopic neutral-ionic domain boundary is allowed to emerge by such\nsubstantial interchain couplings. In the neutral-to-ionic transition, by\ncontrast, the transferred charge density is almost a linear function of the\nphotoexcitation density. Interchain electron-electron interactions make the\nfunction slightly nonlinear, but the uncooperative situation is almost\nunchanged and consistent with the experimental findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2006 09:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Results suggest that, once variations in the catalog data resulting\nfrom technical and network issues are accounted for, all of these natural\nearthquake systems display stationary periods of metastable equilibrium and\neffective ergodicity that are disrupted by large events. We conclude that a\nconstant rate of events is an important prerequisite for these periods of\npunctuated ergodicity, and that while the level of temporal variability in the\nspatial statistics is the controlling factor in the ergodic behavior of seismic\nnetworks, no single statistic is sufficient to ensure quantification of\nergodicity. Specifically, we demonstrate that stationarity, while a necessary\ncondition, is not sufficient to ensure ergodicity in fault systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Apr 2006 21:36:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2006 19:54:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In a closed-loop correction cycle these\nphase steps have to be measured with the highest possible precision using\nnatural reference stars, that is with a small number of photons. In this paper\nthe classical Fisher information of statistics is used for calculating the\nCramer-Rao bound, which determines the limit to the precision with which the\nheight of the steps can be estimated in an unbiased fashion with a given number\nof photons and a given measuring device. Four types of measurement devices are\ndiscussed: a Shack-Hartmann sensor with one small cylindrical lenslet covering\na sub-aperture centred over a border, a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer, a\nFoucault test, and a curvature sensor. The Cramer-Rao bound is calculated for\nall sensors under ideal conditions, that is narrowband measurements without\nadditional noise or disturbances apart from the photon shot noise. This limit\nis compared with the ultimate quantum statistical limit for the estimate of\nsuch a step which is independent of the measuring device. For the\nShack-Hartmann sensor, the effects on the Cramer-Rao bound of broadband\nmeasurements, finite sampling, and disturbances such as atmospheric seeing and\ndetector readout noise are also investigated. The methods presented here can be\nused to compare the precision limits of various devices for measuring phase\nsteps and for optimising the parameters of the devices. Under ideal conditions\nthe Shack-Hartmann and the Foucault devices nearly attain the ultimate quantum\nstatistical limits, whereas the Mach-Zehnder and the curvature devices each\nrequire approximately twenty times as many photons in order to reach the same\nprecision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Apr 2006 10:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
