We discuss how all three\ntypes occur in astrophysics whereas plasma confinement device dynamos are of\nthe first type. Type 3 dynamos requires no magnetic or kinetic helicity of any\nkind. Focusing on type 1 and 2 dynamos, we show how different limits of a\nunified set of equations for magnetic helicity evolution reveal both types. We\nexplicitly describe a steady-state example of a type 1 dynamo, and three\nexamples of type 2 dynamos: (i) closed volume and time dependent; (ii)\nsteady-state with open boundaries; (iii) time dependent with open boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Apr 2006 21:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A differentiable\nmap $F$ from a manifold $M$ into $\\Lambda G$, is said to be of \\emph{connection\norder $(_a^b)$} if the Fourier expansion in the loop parameter $\\lambda$ of the\n${\\mathbb S}^1$-family of Maurer-Cartan forms for $F$, namely $F_\\lambda^{-1}\n\\dd F_\\lambda$, is of the form $\\sum_{i=a}^b \\alpha_i \\lambda^i$. Most\nintegrable systems in geometry are associated to such a map. Roughly speaking,\nthe DPW method used a Birkhoff type splitting to reduce a harmonic map into a\nsymmetric space, which can be represented by a certain order $(_{-1}^1)$ map,\ninto a pair of simpler maps of order $(_{-1}^{-1})$ and $(_1^1)$ respectively.\nConversely, one could construct such a harmonic map from any pair of\n$(_{-1}^{-1})$ and $(_1^1)$ maps. This allowed a Weierstrass type description\nof harmonic maps into symmetric spaces. We extend this method to show that, for\na large class of loop groups, a connection order $(_a^b)$ map, for $a<0<b$,\nsplits uniquely into a pair of $(_a^{-1})$ and $(_1^b)$ maps. As an\napplication, we show that constant non-zero curvature submanifolds with flat\nnormal bundle of a sphere or hyperbolic space split into pairs of flat\nsubmanifolds, reducing the problem (at least locally) to the flat case. To\nextend the DPW method sufficiently to handle this problem requires a more\ngeneral Iwasawa type splitting of the loop group, which we prove always holds\nat least locally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2006 13:16:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2006 15:11:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Feb 2008 12:23:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 25 Apr 2008 05:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 13 May 2008 06:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-30"}

We considered double-loop\natom interferometers and found appropriate condition to eliminate their\nsensitivity to acceleration to get atomic gyroscope, or to eliminate the\nsensitivity to rotation to increase accuracy of the atomic gravimeter.\nConsequent use of these interferometers allows one to measure all components of\nthe acceleration and rotation frequency projection on the plane perpendicular\nto gravity acceleration. Atom interference on the Raman transition driving by\nnoncounterpropagating optical fields is proposed to exclude stimulated echo\nprocesses which can affect the accuracy of the atomic gyroscopes. Using\nnoncounterpropagating optical fields allows one to get a new type of the Ramsey\nfringes arising in the unidirectional Raman pulses and therefore centered at\nthe two-quantum line center. Density matrix in the Wigner representation is\nused to perform calculations. It is shown that in the time between pulses, in\nthe noninertial frame, for atoms with fully quantized spatial degrees of\nfreedom, this density matrix obeys classical Liouville equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2006 04:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2006 19:53:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 May 2006 20:04:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2006 23:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
