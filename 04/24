Elliptical\ngalaxies appear to fall into two distinct categories based on these parameters:\nbright, boxy shaped, with little or no rotation, and less luminous, disky\nshaped with significant rotation. One viable formation scenario is the ``Merger\nhypothesis,'' in which two disk galaxies merge to form a new elliptical galaxy.\nA comparison of the luminosity, photometric shape, and amount of rotation in\nadvanced merger remnants may shed more light on the possible formation\nscenarios of elliptical galaxies. Yet, little observational data exists for\nsuch merger remnants. This paper is the third in a series investigating the\nphotometric and kinematic properties of a sample of 51 optically selected\nadvanced merger remnants. Presented here are K-band isophotal shapes and\nspatially resolved kinematics for a sub-sample of 37 merger remnants. The\nresults show that ~ 11% of the sample are boxy, and anisotropically supported\nwhile ~ 47% are disky, and rotationally supported. The remainder of the sample\nshow variations among expected correlations between shape and rotation. This\nmay suggest that the isophotal shapes are still ``in flux.'' There does appear\nto be a lower limit to the amount of anisotropy observed in the merger\nremnants. This may provide an observational diagnostic for discriminating among\nformation scenarios in elliptical galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Apr 2006 15:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The present system, which lacks quenched randomness,\nconsists of Ising spins located on a cubic lattice, with each plaquette\ncontributing to the total energy the product of the four spins located at its\ncorners. Similarly to our previous findings, energy leaves the system in rare\nbut large, so called intermittent, bursts which are embedded in reversible and\nequilibrium-like fluctuations of zero average. The intermittent bursts, or\nquakes, dissipate the excess energy trapped in the initial state at a rate\nwhich falls off with the inverse of the age. This strongly heterogeneous\ndynamical picture is explained using the idea that quakes are triggered by\nenergy fluctuations of record size, which occur independently within a number\nof thermalized domains. From the temperature dependence of the width of the\nreversible heat fluctuations we surmise that these domains have an exponential\ndensity of states. Finally, we show that the heat flow consists of a\ntemperature independent term and a term with an Arrhenius temperature\ndependence.

Traditional approaches have been using network theory, and the\ntheory of random networks. Under that paradigm, every social agent is\nrepresented by a node, and every social interaction is represented by a segment\nconnecting two nodes. Early work in family interactions, as well as more recent\nwork in the study of terrorist organizations, shows that network modeling may\nbe insufficient to describe the complexity of human social structures.\nSpecifically, network theory does not seem to have enough flexibility to\nrepresent higher order aggregations, where several agents interact as a group,\nrather than as a collection of pairs. The model we present here uses a well\nestablished mathematical theory, the theory of simplicial complexes, to address\nthis complex issue prevalent in interpersonal and intergroup communication. The\ntheory enables us to provide a richer graphical representation of social\ninteractions, and to determine quantitative mechanisms to describe the\nrobustness of a social structure. We also propose a methodology to create\nrandom simplicial complexes, with the purpose of providing a new method to\nsimulate computationally the creation and disgregation of social structures.\nFinally, we propose several measures which could be taken and observed in order\nto describe and study an actual social aggregation occurring in interpersonal\nand intergroup contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Apr 2006 19:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The proposed algorithms are suboptimal due to the\napproximate objective function and the constraint relaxation steps.

In the present\nwork an extension of the model to high temperatures and densities recently\nproposed by Casalbuoni, Gatto, Nardulli, and Ruggieri is used in connection\nwith an implicit regularization scheme. This is done by making use of scaling\nrelations of the divergent one-loop integrals that relate these integrals at\ndifferent energy-momentum scales. Fixing the pion decay constant at the chiral\nsymmetry breaking scale in the vacuum, the scaling relations predict a running\ncoupling constant that decreases as the regularization scale increases,\nimplementing in a schematic way the property of asymptotic freedom of quantum\nchromodynamics. If the regularization scale is allowed to increase with density\nand temperature, the coupling will decrease with density and temperature,\nextending in this way the applicability of the model to high densities and\ntemperatures.
