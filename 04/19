In this scenario, the gas from\nthe outer gas-rich ring loses energy through bar-driven shocks and falls to the\ncentre. Heating of the gas to X-ray temperatures comes from the high velocity\nthat it reaches ($\\approx$ 700 \\kms) as it falls to the bottom of the potential\nwell. This would explain why the stellar metallicity in the bulge region is\naround solar while the hot gas metallicity is around 0.1 solar. We carried out\nan observational test to check this hypothesis by measuring the metallicity of\nHII regions in the outer ring to check whether they matched the hot gas\nmetallicity. For this purpose we obtained medium resolution long slit\nspectroscopy with FORS1 on the ESO VLT at Paranal and obtained the\nmetallicities using emission line ratio diagnostics. The obtained metallicities\nare compatible with the bulge stellar metallicities but very different from the\nhot-gas metallicity. However, when comparing the different time-scales, the gas\nin the ring had time enough to get enriched through stellar processes,\ntherefore we cannot rule out the dynamical mechanism as the heating process of\nthe gas. However, the blue colours of the outer ring and the dust structures in\nthe bar region could suggest that the origin of the X-ray hot gas is due to the\ninfall of material from further out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2006 16:39:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We present high-resolution optical spectra of the dwarf nova U Gem\nin quiescence taken to test the accuracy to which the HST value can be\nrecovered from optical data. We find that, even with data of very high S/N we\ncannot recover Long et al.'s value to better than about 20% by any method.\nContamination by neighbouring emission lines seems a likely culprit. Our data\nreveal a number of new features: Doppler tomograms show emission at low\nvelocity, close to the centre of mass, and a transient, narrow absorption\nfeature is seen in the Balmer lines near the line centres at the time of\neclipse. We suggest that stellar prominences, as previously invoked for the\ndwarf novae IP Peg and SS Cyg in outburst, may explain both of these features.\nThe He II 4686.75 A line emission is dominated by the gas stream/disc impact\nregion. Two distinct spots are seen in Doppler maps, the first being very\nnarrow and showing a velocity close to that of the accretion disc in the impact\nregion, and the second much broader and located between the velocities of the\n(ballistic) stream and the (Keplerian) disc. We present tentative evidence of\nweak spiral structure. We find no evidence of stream-disc overflow in the\nsystem. Our data suggests an inclination angle > 70 degrees, adding to the\nevidence of a puzzle in the mass of U Gem's white dwarf. The mass donor is\nclearly seen in the Doppler maps, with emission concentrated towards its poles,\nand mainly on the side facing the white dwarf. This suggests irradiation with\nshielding by the disc from which we estimate an H/R ratio between 0.15 and\n0.25.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2006 22:22:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Here a frame is based on a set of\nreal and of complex numbers and a space time as a 4-tuple of the real numbers.\nThere are many isomorphic frames as there are many isomorphic sets of real\nnumbers. Each frame is suitable for construction of all physical theories as\nmathematical structures over the real and complex numbers. The organization of\nthe frames into a field of frames is based on the representations of real and\ncomplex numbers as Cauchy operators defined on complex rational states of\nfinite qubit strings. The structure of the field is based on noting that the\nconstruction of real and complex numbers as Cauchy operators in a frame can be\niterated to create new frames coming from a frame. Gauge transformations on the\nrational string states greatly expand the number of quantum frames as, for each\ngauge U, there is one frame coming from the original frame. Forward and\nbackward iteration of the construction yields a two way infinite frame field\nwith satisfying properties. There is no background space time and there are no\nreal or complex numbers for the field as a whole. Instead these are relative\nconcepts associated with each frame in the field. Extension to include qukit\nstrings for different k bases, is described as is the problem of reconciling\nthe frame field to the existence of just one frame with one background space\ntime for the observable physical universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2006 20:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
