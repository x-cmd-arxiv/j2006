The latter in turn is coupled to a phonon bath that\nrepresents the thermal environment. We focus on the zero frequency noise\nspectrum and study the changes in its behavior under weak and strong\nelectron-phonon interactions.

In\nparticular the relative Fano factor decreases with increasing off resonance\ndistance and junction asymmetry.

Such sidebands can be observed when\ndisplaying the noise against the source-drain voltage, but not in noise vs.\ngate voltage plots obtained at low source-drain bias.

We consider a stochastic\ndiscrete model with birth, death, competition, mutation and spatial diffusion,\nwhere all the parameters may depend both on the position and on the trait of\nindividuals. The spatial motion is driven by a reflected diffusion in a bounded\ndomain. The interaction is modelled as a trait competition between individuals\nwithin a given spatial interaction range. First, we give an algorithmic\nconstruction of the process. Next, we obtain large population approximations,\nas weak solutions of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations with Neumann's\nboundary conditions. As the spatial interaction range is fixed, the\nnonlinearity is nonlocal. Then, we make the interaction range decrease to zero\nand prove the convergence to spatially localized nonlinear reaction-diffusion\nequations, with Neumann's boundary conditions.

It is shown here that a\nlinear stability analysis of similarity solutions of the plane mixing layer,\nincluding the effects of flow non-parallelism, using the minimal composite\ntheory and the properties of adjoints following Govindarajan & Narasimha\n(2005), resolves the issue by yielding non-zero critical Reynolds numbers for\ncoflowing streams of any velocity ratio. The critical Reynolds number so found,\nbased on the vorticity thickness and the velocity differential as scales,\nvaries in the narrow range of 59 to 55 as the velocity ratio goes from zero to\nunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2006 10:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Noise, therefore, also plays an\nimportant role in many models of neural impulse generation. Noise is not only\nintroduced for more realistic simulations but also to account for cooperative\neffects between noisy and nonlinear dynamics. Often, this is achieved by a\nsimple noise term in the membrane equation (current noise). However, there are\nongoing discussions whether such current noise is justified or whether rather\nconductance noise should be introduced because it is closer to the natural\norigin of noise. Therefore, we have compared the effects of current and\nconductance noise in a neuronal model for subthreshold oscillations and action\npotential generation. We did not see any significant differences in the model\nbehavior with respect to voltage traces, tuning curves of interspike-intervals,\ninterval distributions or frequency responses when the noise strength is\nadjusted. These findings indicate that simple current noise can give reasonable\nresults in neuronal simulations with regard to physiological relevant noise\neffects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2006 13:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
