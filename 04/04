The dense gas surrounding the galaxy is\nradiating X-rays with a luminosity of ~1E45 erg/s consistent with a cooling\nrate of ~1000-2000 solar masses per year. However, Chandra and XMM-Newton\nobservations find less than 200 solar masses per year of gas cooling below ~2\nkeV, a level that is consistent with the cD's current star formation rate of\n100-180 solar masses per year. One or more heating agents (feedback) must then\nbe replenishing the remaining radiative losses. The heat fluxes from supernova\nexplosions and thermal conduction alone are unable to do so. However, a pair of\nX-ray cavities from an AGN outburst has deposited ~1.7E60 erg into the\nsurrounding gas over the past 40 Myr. The corresponding jet power 1.4E45\nerg/sec is enough to offset most of the radiative losses from the cooling gas.\nThe jet power exceeds the radio synchrotron power by ~4000 times, making this\none of the most radiatively inefficient radio sources known. The large jet\npower implies that the cD's supermassive black hole accreted at a mean rate of\n  ~0.3 solar masses per year over the last 40 Myr or so, which is a small\nfraction of the Eddington accretion rate for a 10E9 solar mass black hole. The\nratio of the bulge growth rate through star formation and the black hole growth\nrate through accretion is consistent with the slope of the (Magorrian)\nrelationship between bulge and central black hole mass in nearby quiescent\ngalaxies. The consistency between net cooling, heating (feedback), and the\ncooling sink (star formation) in this system resolves the primary objection to\ntraditional cooling flow models.

We therefore present transport\ncoefficients for chemical mixing and angular momentum redistribution by\nmagnetic torques that are significantly different from previous published\nvalues. The new magnetic viscosity is reduced by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude\ncompared to the old one, and we find that magnetic angular momentum transport\nby this mechanism is very sensitive to gradients in the mean molecular weight.\nThe revised coefficients are more compatible with empirical constraints on the\ntimescale of core-envelope coupling in young stars than the previous ones.\nHowever, solar models including only this mechanism possess a rapidly rotating\ncore, in contradiction with helioseismic data.

METHODS: We present\nanalytical kinematic predictions valid soon after the Alfv\\'en surface for all\ntypes of steady magnetically self-confined jets. RESULTS: We show that extended\ndisc winds, X-winds, and stellar winds occupy distinct regions in the poloidal\nspeed vs. specific angular momentum plane. Comparisons with current\nobservations of T Tauri jets yield quantitative constraints on the range of\nlaunching radii, magnetic lever arms, and specific energy input in disc and\nstellar winds. Implications on the origin of jet asymmetries and disc magnetic\nfields are outlined. CONCLUSIONS: We argue that ejection phenomena from\naccreting T Tauri stars most likely include three dynamical components: (1) an\nouter self-collimated steady disc wind carrying most of the mass-flux in the\noptical jet (when present), confining (2) a pressure-driven coronal stellar\nwind and (3) a hot inner flow made of blobs sporadically ejected from the\nmagnetopause. If the stellar magnetic moment is parallel to the disc magnetic\nfield, then the highly variable inner flow resembles a \"Reconnection X-wind\",\nthat has been proven to efficiently brake down an accreting and contracting\nyoung star. If the magnetic moment is anti-parallel, then larger versions of\nthe solar coronal mass ejections are likely to occur. The relative importance\nof these three components in the observed outflows and the range of radii\ninvolved in the disc wind are expected to vary with time, from the stage of\nembedded source to the optically revealed T Tauri star phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2006 06:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The issue of rattling atoms in spacious\nlattice sites is a separate occurrence that can also lead to a high density of\nlow energy states (unusual low temperature thermodynamics) and to practical\napplications such as in improved thermoelectric materials. In this letter we\naddress a unique situation where both phenomena arise: a four-fold single-site\ninstability leads to rattling of cations on a diamond structure sublattice\nwhere nn interactions frustrate simple ordering of the displacements. The\nsystem deals with this coupling of rattling+frustration by commensurate\nordering. Such a disorder-order transition may account for the second phase\ntransition seen in KOs2O6 within the superconducting state, and the unusual\nlow-energy dynamics and associated electron-phonon coupling can account for the\nqualitative differences in physical properties of KOs2O6 compared to RbOs2O6\nand CsOs2O6, all of which have essentially identical average crystal and\nelectronic structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2006 07:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This notion was introduced by P. Kurka\nand A. Maass. It is a refinement of the classical notion of omega-limit sets\ndealing with the typical long term behavior of cellular automata. It focuses on\nthe words whose probability of appearance does not tend to 0 as time tends to\ninfinity (the persistent words). In this paper, we give a characterisation of\nthe persistent language for non sensible cellular automata associated with\nBernouilli measures. We also study the computational complexity of these\nlanguages. We show that the persistent language can be non-recursive. But our\nmain result is that the set of quasi-nilpotent cellular automata (those with a\nsingle configuration in their mu-limit set) is neither recursively enumerable\nnor co-recursively enumerable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2006 10:21:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2006 08:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This accounts for the production of OH- ions\nnear the branches and the reactions with Zn++ ions. The steady state solution\nshows both species growing with the rate of the branches, and qualitatively\nexplains their catalytic effect. Subsequently, we propose a more realistic\nstatistical model for the formation of the hybrid deposits from Zn++ ions, a\nhydroxide precursor and eosin in solution. Simple probabilistic rules are used\nfor reactions of eosin and oxygen, taking into account diffusion from solution\nalong the same lines of the diffusion-limited aggregation models. The catalytic\neffect is represented by the preferencial production of OH- ions near eosin\nbranches, which form ZnO species. An improvement of the growth rate is possible\nonly with a rather large diffusion coefficient of eosin in solution compared to\nthat of hydroxide precursors, in agreement with experimental findings.

We find that any entanglement\nfeature exhibited by the 2D cluster state must also be present in any other\nuniversal resource. We obtain a powerful criterion to assess universality of\ngraph states, by introducing an entanglement measure which necessarily grows\nunboundedly with the system size for all universal resource states.\nFurthermore, we prove that graph states associated with 2D lattices such as the\nhexagonal and triangular lattice are universal, and obtain the first example of\na universal non-graph state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Apr 2006 19:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2006 15:55:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the latter case the smaller\nsubsystem is usually a single spin or a block of adjacent spins and the\nentanglement differentiates between critical and non-critical regimes. Here we\nextend this approach by considering a more general setting: our smaller\nsubsystem $S_A$ consists of a {\\it comb} of $L$ spins, spaced $p$ sites apart.\nOur results are thus not restricted to a simple `area law', but contain\nnon-local information, parameterized by the spacing $p$. For the XX model we\ncalculate the von-Neumann entropy analytically when $N\\to \\infty$ and\ninvestigate its dependence on $L$ and $p$.
