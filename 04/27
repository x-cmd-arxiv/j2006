The 2H NMR line shape further indicates that the segmental motion is\ngoverned by dynamical heterogeneities. While the width of the distribution of\ncorrelation times G(log tau) is moderate for low and high salt content, an\nextremely broad distribution exists for an intermediate salt concentration 15:1\nPPO-LiClO4.

A universal\nimplementation would have made the PHOTOS solution less modular and less\nconvenient for the users.

We find the exact form of the quartic interaction terms in the\ngeneralized LL type action whose quantum\n  S-matrix matches the low-energy limit of the asymptotic S-matrix of the spin\nchain of Beisert, Dippel and Staudacher (BDS). This generalises to all orders\nin the `t Hooft coupling an earlier computation of Klose and Zarembo of the\nS-matrix of the standard LL model. We also consider a generalization to the\ncase when the spin chain S-matrix contains an extra ``string'' phase and\ndetermine the exact form of the LL 4-vertex corresponding to the low-energy\nlimit of the ansatz of Arutyunov, Frolov and Staudacher (AFS). We explain the\nrelation between the resulting ``non-relativistic'' non-local action and the\nsecond-derivative string sigma model. We comment on modifications introduced by\nstrong-coupling corrections to the AFS phase. We mostly discuss the SU(2)\nsector but also present generalizations to the SL(2) and SU(1|1) sectors,\nconfirming universality of the dressing phase contribution by matching the\nlow-energy limit of the AFS-type spin chain S-matrix with tree-level\nstring-theory S-matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2006 22:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2006 16:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

Practically, this can be achieved by extracellularly\nrecording from multiple brain sites using single wire electrodes. However, in\ndensely packed neural structures such as the human hippocampus, a single\nelectrode can record the activity of multiple neurons. Thus, analytic\ntechniques that differentiate action potentials of different neurons are\nrequired. Offline spike sorting approaches are currently used to detect and\nsort action potentials after finishing the experiment. Because the\nopportunities to record from the human brain are relatively rare, it is\ndesirable to analyze large numbers of simultaneous recordings quickly using\nonline sorting and detection algorithms. In this way, the experiment can be\noptimized for the particular response properties of the recorded neurons. Here\nwe present and evaluate a method that is capable of detecting and sorting\nextracellular single-wire recordings in realtime.
