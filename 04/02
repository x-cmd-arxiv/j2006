Such construction cab be applied to wide class of Lax operators,\nrelated to the simple Lie algebras g. We construct the kernel of the resolvent\nof L in terms of FAS and derive the spectral decompositions of L.

In this paper, we present a radically new way of\nprecisely measuring hyperfine shifts, and demonstrate its effectiveness in the\ncase of the hyperfine shift of $4s\\_{1/2}$ and $4p\\_{1/2}$ in\n$^{207}\\mathrm{Pb}^{53+}$. It is based on the precise detection of dielectronic\nresonances that occur in electron-ion recombination at very low energy. This\nallows us to determine the hyperfine constant to around 0.6 meV accuracy which\nis on the order of 10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2006 11:44:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This mechanism\noperates for reaction schemes which, when modeled using deterministic rate\nequations, fail to exhibit oscillations for any values of rate constants. The\nmechanism relies on amplification of the underlying stochasticity of reaction\nkinetics within a narrow window of frequencies. This amplification allows\nfluctuations to beat the central limit theorem, having a dominant effect even\nthough the number of molecules in the system is relatively large. The mechanism\nis quantitatively studied within simple models of self-regulatory gene\nexpression, and glycolytic oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2006 13:58:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
