Our simulation tracks\n1024^3 dark matter particles, in a box of co-moving side length 65.6 Mpc/h.\nThis large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of\nHII regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our\nsimulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for\nreionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: HII regions\ngrow collectively around highly-clustered sources, and have a well-defined\ncharacteristic size, which evolves from a sub-Mpc scale at the beginning of\nreionization to R > 10 Mpc towards the end. We present a detailed statistical\ndescription of our results, and compare them with a numerical scheme based on\nthe analytic model by Furlanetto, Zaldarriaga, and Hernquist. We find that the\nanalytic calculation reproduces the size distribution of HII regions and the 21\ncm power spectrum of the radiative transfer simulation remarkably well. The\nionization field from the simulation, however, has more small scale structure\nthan the analytic calculation, owing to Poisson scatter in the simulated\nabundance of galaxies on small scales. We propose and validate a simple scheme\nto incorporate this scatter into our calculations. Our results suggest that\nanalytic calculations are sufficiently accurate to aid in predicting and\ninterpreting the results of future 21 cm surveys. In particular, our fast\nnumerical scheme is useful for forecasting constraints from future 21 cm\nsurveys, and in constructing mock surveys to test data analysis procedures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2006 20:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2010 16:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-19"}

We are able to place a new constraint on the total\nbinary fraction in these objects, which suggests that they are more likely the\nresult of extending the same processes at work at higher masses into this mass\nrange, rather than a distinct mode of formation. Our basic result is that there\nare $6 \\pm 2$ out of 53, or $11^{+0.07}_{-0.04}$% spectroscopic binaries in the\nseparation range 0-6 AU, nearly as many as resolved binaries. This leads to an\nestimate of an upper limit of $26 \\pm 10$% for the binary fraction of VLM\nobjects (it is an upper limit because of the possible overlap between the\nspectroscopic and resolved populations). A reasonable estimate for the very\nlow-mass binary fraction is $20 - 25$%. We consider several possible separation\nand frequency distributions, including the same one as found for GK stars, a\ncompressed version of that, a version of the compressed distribution truncated\nat 15 AU, and a theoretical distribution which considers the evaporation of\nsmall-N clusters.

We do not find support for the ``ejection hypothesis'' as their\ndominant mode of formation, particularly in view of the similarity in the total\nbinary fraction compared with slightly more massive stars, and the difficulty\nthis mechanism has in producing numerous binary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2006 07:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We call this\nscenario the LXCDM model. One possibility for X would be a scalar field, but it\nis not the only one. The overall equation of state (EOS) of the LXCDM model can\neffectively appear as quintessence or phantom energy depending on the mixture\nof the two components. Both the dynamics of Lambda and of X could be linked to\nhigh energy effects near the Planck scale. In the case of Lambda it may be\nrelated to the running of this parameter under quantum effects, whereas X might\nbe identified with some fundamental field (say, a dilaton) left over as a\nlow-energy ``relic'' by e.g. string theory. We find that the dynamics of the\nLXCDM model can trigger a future stopping of the Universe expansion and can\nkeep the ratio rho_D/rho_m (DE density to matter-radiation density) bounded and\nof order 1. Therefore, the model could explain the so-called ``cosmological\ncoincidence problem''. This is in part related to the possibility that the\npresent value of the cosmological term can be Lambda<0 in this framework (the\ncurrent total DE density nevertheless being positive). However, a cosmic halt\ncould occur even if Lambda>0 because of the peculiar behavior of X as ``Phantom\nMatter''.

Motivated by this fact, we study the effect of the leading\nalpha'^3 corrections in type IIB string theory for this scenario. Within the\nassumptions of: weak coupling, adiabatic evolution and thermodynamical\nequilibrium, we perturbatively solved the corresponding equations of motion in\ntwo different cases: (i) the isotropic case which is governed by a single scale\nfactor and (ii) the anisotropic case given by two different scale factors. In\nthe first case, we consider two regimes (ia) The Hagedorn regime where the\nstring gas equation of state is that of pressureless dust, and (ib) the\nradiation regime. In the second case, (ii), we only considered a radiation-like\nequation of state. We found that the inclusion of alpha' corrections affects\nthe scale factor(s) in opposite way in the Hagedorn and in the radiation\nregimes, acting as a driving force for the first one and a damping force for\nthe second one. This effect is small for reasonable initial conditions and it\nis only observed at early times. Morever it is bigger in the Hagedorn regime\nthan in the radiation regime.

Intrinsic properties\nof fermions (exclusion principle and spin) affect strongly the interaction of\nfermions with both Hawking radiation and metric of the spacetime. In particular\nwe have found the following: first, while the fermion vacuum state seen by the\nRindler observer is an entangled state in which the right and left Rindler\nwedge states appear in correlated pairs as in the case of the scalar particles,\nthe entanglement disappears in the excited state due to the exclusion\nprinciple; second, the spin of the fermion experiences the Winger rotation\nunder a uniform acceleration; and third, the quantum information of fermions\nencoded in spin (entangled state is composed of different spin states but with\nthe same mode function) is dissipated not by the Hawking radiation but by the\nWigner rotation as the pair approaches the event horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2006 16:57:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2006 04:27:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Sep 2006 04:19:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\ndispersion relation reduces the group velocity of the wave function of the\nphotons, so that it enhances nonlinear interaction of the photons. (Because\nvariation of the group velocity against the wave vector is very steep, we have\nto tune up the wavelength of injected photons precisely, however.)
