The galaxy morphology is very different shortward\nand longward of ~5 microns: short-wavelength imaging shows an underlying red\nstellar population, with the central super star cluster (SSC) dominating the\nluminosity; longer-wavelength data reveals warm dust emission arising from two\noff-nuclear regions offset by ~250 pc from the SSC. These regions show little\nextinction at optical wavelengths. The galaxy has a relatively low global dust\nmass (~2E5 solar masses, implying a global dust-to-gas mass ratio ~2--4 times\nlower than the Milky Way average). The off-nuclear dust emission appears to be\npowered by photons from the same stellar population responsible for the\nexcitation of the observed H Alpha emission; these photons are unassociated\nwith the SSC (though a contribution from embedded sources to the IR luminosity\nof the off-nuclear regions cannot be ruled out). Low-resolution IRS\nspectroscopy shows moderate-strength PAH emission in the 11.3 micron band in\nthe eastern peak; no PAH emission is detected in the SSC or the western dust\nemission complex. There is significant diffuse 8 micron emission after scaling\nand subtracting shorter wavelength data; the spatially variable PAH emission\nstrengths revealed by the IRS data suggest caution in the interpretation of\ndiffuse 8 micron emission as arising from PAH carriers alone. The metallicity\nof NGC 1705 falls at the transition level of 35% solar found by Engelbracht and\ncollaborators; the fact that a system at this metallicity shows spatially\nvariable PAH emission demonstrates the complexity of interpreting diffuse 8\nmicron emission.

However, a\nlack of formal analysis tools makes emergent coordination algorithms difficult\nto design. In this paper we present a mathematical model of a general dynamic\ntask allocation mechanism. Robots using this mechanism have to choose between\ntwo types of task, and the goal is to achieve a desired task division in the\nabsence of explicit communication and global knowledge.

In the leading order of perturbation theory, generation of $(2k+1)$th\nharmonic is described by a loop diagram with $(2k+2)$ external incoming, and\ntwo outgoing legs. A frequency of the beam is assumed to be much smaller than\nthe Compton frequency, so that the approximation of a constant uniform\nelectromagnetic field is valid locally. Analytical expressions for angular\ndistribution of generated photons, as well as for their total emission rate are\nobtained in the leading order of perturbation theory. Influence of higher-order\ndiagrams is studied numerically using the formalism of Intense Field QED. It is\nshown that the process may become observable for the beam intensity of the\norder of $10^{27}\\rm{W/cm}^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2006 23:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2006 17:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This is really an abstract\napplication of the theory of operator algebras to wavelet theory. The concrete\napplications of this method include results obtained using specially\nconstructed families of wavelet sets. A frame is a sequence of vectors in a\nHilbert space which is a compression of a basis for a larger space. This is not\nthe usual definition in the frame literature, but it is easily equivalent to\nthe usual definition. Because of this compression relationship between frames\nand bases, the unitary system approach to wavelets (and more generally:\nwandering vectors) is perfectly adaptable to frame theory. The use of the local\ncommutant is along the same lines as in the wavelet theory. Finally, we discuss\nconstructions of frames with special properties using targeted decompositions\nof positive operators, and related problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2006 04:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It results from the\ninteraction of an electromagnetic wave with a planar chiral structure patterned\non the sub-wavelength scale, and manifests itself in asymmetric transmission of\ncircularly polarized waves in the opposite directions through the structure and\nelliptically polarized eigenstates. The new effect is radically different from\nconventional gyrotropy of three-dimensional chiral media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Apr 2006 14:50:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-09-14"}

In the modern literature 'Virus evolution' has come to refer to\nstudy more akin to population genetics, such as the world-wide scrutiny on new\npolymorphisms appearing daily in the H5N1 avian flu virus [1], than to the\nfundamental interrogation: where do viruses come from? This situation is now\nrapidly changing, due to the coincidence of bold new ideas (and sometimes the\nrevival of old ones), the unexpected features exhibited by recently isolated\nspectacular viruses [2] (see at URL: www.giantvirus.org), as well as the steady\nincrease of genomic sequences for 'regular' viruses and cellular organisms\nenhancing the power of comparative genomics [3]. After being considered\nnon-living and relegated in the wings by a majority of biologists, viruses are\nnow pushed back on the center stage: they might have been at the origin of DNA,\nof the eukaryotic cell, and even of today's partition of biological organisms\ninto 3 domains of life: bacteria, archaea and eukarya. Here, I quickly survey\nsome of the recent discoveries and the new evolutionary thoughts they have\nprompted, before adding to the confusion with one interrogation of my own: what\nif we totally missed the true nature of (at least some) viruses?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2006 16:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We calculate explicitly the weak\nsolutions of the McKendrick equation and of the Lotka renewal integral equation\nwith time and age dependent birth rate. Mortality modulus is considered age\ndependent. We show the existence of demography cycles. For a population with\nonly one reproductive age class, independently of the stability of the weak\nsolutions and after a transient time, the temporal evolution of the number of\nindividuals of a population is always modulated by a time periodic function.\nThe periodicity of the cycles is equal to the age of the reproductive age\nclass, and a population retains the memory from the initial data through the\namplitude of oscillations. For a population with a continuous distribution of\nreproductive age classes, the amplitude of oscillation is damped. The\nperiodicity of the damped cycles is associated with the age of the first\nreproductive age class. Damping increases as the dispersion of the fertility\nfunction around the age class with maximal fertility increases. In general, the\nperiod of the demography cycles is associated with the time that a species\ntakes to reach the reproductive maturity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2006 18:50:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Sep 2006 12:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Although Hamiltonians\ntheoretically exist that can implement a universal set of logic gates on DFS\nencoded qubits without ever leaving the protected subsystem, the natural\nHamiltonians that are available in specific implementations do not necessarily\nhave this property. Here we describe some of the principles that can be used in\nsuch cases to operate on encoded qubits without losing the protection offered\nby the DFS. In particular, we show how dynamical decoupling can be used to\ncontrol decoherence during the unavoidable excursions outside of the DFS. By\nmeans of cumulant expansions, we show how the fidelity of quantum gates\nimplemented by this method on a simple two-physical-qubit DFS depends on the\ncorrelation time of the noise responsible for decoherence. We further show by\nmeans of numerical simulations how our previously introduced \"strongly\nmodulating pulses\" for NMR quantum information processing can permit\nhigh-fidelity operations on multiple DFS encoded qubits in practice, provided\nthat the rate at which the system can be modulated is fast compared to the\ncorrelation time of the noise. The principles thereby illustrated are expected\nto be broadly applicable to many implementations of quantum information\nprocessors based on DFS encoded qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2006 18:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
