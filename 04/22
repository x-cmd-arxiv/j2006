This calls for tools and\nmethods for building an advanced information-processing infrastructure. One\nissue in this area is the selection of suitable information sources in query\nanswering. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach to this\nproblem, in the setting where one among a set of information sources\n(prototypically, data repositories) should be selected for evaluating a user\nquery. We use extended logic programs (ELPs) to represent rich descriptions of\nthe information sources, an underlying domain theory, and user queries in a\nformal query language (here, XML-QL, but other languages can be handled as\nwell). Moreover, we use ELPs for declarative query analysis and generation of a\nquery description. Central to our approach are declarative source-selection\nprograms, for which we define syntax and semantics. Due to the structured\nnature of the considered data items, the semantics of such programs must\ncarefully respect implicit context information in source-selection rules, and\nfurthermore combine it with possible user preferences. A prototype\nimplementation of our approach has been realized exploiting the DLV KR system\nand its plp front-end for prioritized ELPs.

As usual, the angular part of the wave function is\nexpanded in terms of spherical harmonics. Instead of the usual finite\ndifference (FD) scheme, the radial coordinate is discretized using the discrete\nvariable representation which is constructed from the Coulomb wave function.\nFor an accurate description of the ionization dynamics of atomic systems, the\nCoulomb wave function discrete variable representation (CWDVR) method needs\n3-10 times less grid points than the FD method. The resultant grid points of\nCWDVR distribute unevenly so that one has finer grid near the origin and\ncoarser one at larger distances. The other important advantage of the CWDVR\nmethod is that it treats the Coulomb singularity accurately and gives a good\nrepresentation of continuum wave functions. The time propagation of the wave\nfunction is implemented using the well-known Arnoldi method. As examples, the\npresent method is applied to the multiphoton ionization of both H and H$^-$ in\nintense laser fields. Short-time excitation and ionization dynamics of H by\nstatic electric fields is also investigated. For a wide range of photon\nenergies and laser intensities, ionization rates calculated using this method\nare in excellent agreement with those from other theoretical calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2006 20:15:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These workshops contributed to the development of\nastrophysics and space science, particularly in developing nations. Following a\nprocess of prioritization, the workshops identified the following elements as\nparticularly important for international cooperation in the field: (i)\noperation of astronomical telescope facilities implementing TRIPOD, (ii)\nvirtual observatories, (iii) astrophysical data systems, (iv) concurrent design\ncapabilities for the development of international space missions, and (v)\ntheoretical astrophysics such as applications of nonextensive statistical\nmechanics. Beginning in 2005, the workshops focus on preparations for the\nInternational Heliophysical Year 2007 (IHY2007). The workshops continue to\nfacilitate the establishment of astronomical telescope facilities as pursued by\nJapan and the development of low-cost, ground-based, world-wide instrument\narrays as lead by the IHY secretariat.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2006 20:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Our\nresults offer an explanation as to why so many diverse species of network\nstructure arise in Nature (e.g. fungal systems) under essentially the same\nenvironmental conditions. Our findings are based on an exactly solvable model\nsystem which mimics a variety of biological and social networks. We then extend\nour analysis by introducing a novel renormalization scheme involving cost\nmotifs, to describe analytically the average shortest path across\nmultiple-ring-and-hub networks. As a consequence, we uncover a 'skin effect'\nwhereby the structure of the inner multi-ring core can cease to play any role\nin terms of determining the average shortest path across the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Apr 2006 22:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
