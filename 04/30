Given a curve\n$c$, we define the tangent space $T_cM$ of $M$ at $c$ including in it all\ndeformations $h:S^1\\to R^n$ of $c$. In this paper we study geometries on the\nmanifold of curves, provided by Sobolev--type metrics $H^j$. We study $H^j$\ntype metrics for the cases $j=1,2$; we prove estimates, and characterize the\ncompletion of the space of smooth curves. As a bonus, we prove that the\nFr\\'echet distance of curves (see arXiv:math.DG/0312384) coincides with the\ndistance induced by the ``Finsler $L^\\infinity$ metric'' defined in \\S2.2 in\narXiv:math.DG/0412454.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2006 09:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-06-05"}
