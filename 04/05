The nonlinear regime in\nsuch theories is not well studied, though it is likely that observational tests\nof structure formation will lie in this regime. A class of alternate gravity\ntheories may be approximated by modifying Poisson's equation. We have run\nN-body simulations of a set of such models to study the nonlinear clustering of\nmatter on 1-100 Mpc scales. We find that nonlinear gravity enhances the\ndeviations of the power spectrum of these models from standard gravity. This\noccurs due to mode-coupling, so that models with an excess or deficit of\nlarge-scale power (at k < 0.2/Mpc) lead to deviations in the power spectrum at\nsmaller scales as well (up to k ~ 1/Mpc), even though the linear spectra match\nvery closely on the smaller scales. This makes it easier to distinguish such\nmodels from general relativity using the three-dimensional power spectrum\nprobed by galaxy surveys and the weak lensing power spectrum. If the potential\nfor light deflection is modified in the same way as the potential that affects\nthe dark matter, then weak lensing constrains deviations from gravity even more\nstrongly. Our simulations show that even with a modified potential,\ngravitational evolution is approximately universal. Based on this, the\nPeacock-Dodds approach can be adapted to get an analytical fit for the\nnonlinear power spectra of alternate gravity models, though the recent Smith et\nal formula is less successful. Our conclusions extend to models with\nmodifications of gravity on scales of 1-20 Mpc. We also use a way of measuring\nprojected power spectra from simulations that lowers the sample variance, so\nthat fewer realizations are needed to reach a desired level of accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Apr 2006 19:45:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2006 16:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Nov 2006 20:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\n`upper' sequence is formed by radio selected AGNs, the `lower' sequence\ncontains mainly optically selected objects. Whereas an apparent `gap' between\nthe two sequences may be an artifact of selection effects, the sequences\nthemselves mark the real upper bounds of radio-loudness of two distinct\npopulations of AGNs: those hosted respectively by elliptical and disk galaxies.\nBoth sequences show the same dependence of the radio-loudness on the Eddington\nratio (an increase with decreasing Eddington ratio), which suggests that the\nnormalization of this dependence is determined by the black hole spin. This\nimplies that central black holes in giant elliptical galaxies have (on average)\nmuch larger spins than black holes in spiral/disc galaxies. This\ngalaxy-morphology related radio-dichotomy breaks down at high accretion rates\nwhere the dominant fraction of luminous quasars hosted by elliptical galaxies\nis radio quiet.

This suggests that such\ninstabilities can arise in neutron stars that are differentially, although not\nnecessarily rapidly, rotating. The instability seems to be directly triggered\nby the presence of a corotation resonance inside the star. Our analysis also\nsuggests that a resonant cavity resulting from a local minimum in the radial\nvortensity profile of the star plays an important role in amplifying the\nunstable mode. Hence, it appears as through this instability is closely related\nto the so-called ``Rossby wave instability'' \\citep{LLCN99} that has been found\nto arise in accretion disks. In addition to the one-armed ($m=1$) spiral mode,\nwe have found that higher-order ($m = 2$ and $m=3$) nonaxisymmetric modes also\ncan become unstable if corotation points that resonate with the\neigenfrequencies of these higher-order modes also appear inside the star.

The celebrated theory of F\\\"orster\nresonance energy transfer (FRET), which relates the transfer rate to the\noverlap integral of optical spectra, fails in this situation. We point out that\nin addition to the well-known fact that the point-dipole approximation breaks\ndown (enabling energy transfer between optically forbidden states), also the\nperturbative treatment of the electronic interactions between donor and\nacceptor system, which underlies the F\\\"orster approach, in general loses its\nvalidity due to overlap of the exciton bands.

The validity of the\nconventional perturbative approach is investigated by comparing to the\nnonperturbative one; in general this validity improves for lower temperature\nand larger distances (weaker interactions) between the aggregates.

Combining the present result with other predictions such as light\nneutrino masses and mixing angles, and stability under radiative corrections in\nMSSM, the normal hierarchical model appears to be the most favourable choice of\nnature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2006 08:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In most cases H and A come quite\ndegenerate in mass, and their s-channel production would lead to nearly\noverlapping resonances. CP-violating effects may connect these two Higgs\nbosons, giving origin to one-loop particle mixing, which, due to their mass\nproximity, can be resonantly enhanced. The corresponding transition amplitude\ncontains then CP-even and CP-odd components; besides the signal of\nintereference between both amplitudes, leading to a CP-odd asymmetry, we\npropose to look for the mixing probability itself, a quantity which, although\nCP-even, can originate only from a CP-odd amplitude. We show that, in general,\nthe effect of such a mixing probability cannot be mimicked by (or be\nre-absorbed into) a simple redefinition of the H and A masses in the context of\na CP-conserving model. Specifically, the effects of the CP-mixing are such\nthat, either the mass-splitting of the H and A bosons cannot be accounted for\nin the absence of CP-mixing, and/or the detailed energy dependence of the\nproduced lineshape is clearly different from the one obtained by redefining the\nmasses, but not allowing any mixing.

Due to our\nmethodology, we do not have much hope of proving that there are no other\nsolutions. For the third case we found a solution in a nonic number field, but\nwe were unable to make much progress with the fourth case. We make a few\nconcluding comments and include an appendix from Elkies regarding his\ncalculations and correspondence with Zagier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2006 06:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-03-10"}

Indeed it is known since the works of Aldous (1993) and Le Gall\n(1991) that a continuous non-negative function $h$ on $[0,1]$ such that\n$h(0)=0$ can be seen as the contour process of a compact real tree. This\nparticular coding of a compact real tree provides additional structures, namely\na root that is the vertex corresponding to $0\\in [0,1]$, a linear order\ninherited from the usual order on $[0,1]$ and a measure induced by the Lebesgue\nmeasure on $[0,1]$; of course, the root, the linear order and the measure\nobtained by such a coding have to satisfy some compatibility conditions. In\nthis paper, we prove that any compact real tree equipped with a root, a linear\norder and a measure that are compatible can be encoded by a non-negative\nfunction $h$ defined on a finite interval $[0, M]$, that is assumed to be\nleft-continuous with right-limit, without positive jump and such that\n$h(0+)=h(0)=0$. Moreover, this function is unique if we assume that the\nexploration of the tree induced by such a coding backtracks as less as\npossible. We also prove that a measure-change on the tree corresponds to a\nre-parametrization of the coding function. In addition, we describe several\npath-properties of the coding function in terms of the metric properties of the\nreal tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2006 12:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this\nregion there is not sufficient sunlight over the year to allow for the growth\nof the plants on which these animals feed. Consequently the latitude of these\nregions must have been lower before the end of the Pleistocene than at present.\nIt is a challenge to reconstruct this geographic shift of the poles in a manner\ncompa- tible with known facts. A possible sequence of events is described here.\nIt as- sumes an additional planet, which must since have disappeared. This is\npossible, if it moved in an extremely eccentric orbit and was hot as a result\nof tidal work and solar radiation. During a few million years evaporation of\nthis planet led to a disk-shaped cloud of ions moving around the Sun. This\ncloud partially shielded the Earth from the solar radiation, producing the\nalteration of cold and warm periods characterizing the Pleistocene. The degree\nof shielding is sensitive to the inclination of Earth's orbit, which has a\nperiod of 100000 years. Two cloud structures are discussed. The first is small\nand steady.

These structures are often plates or\narray of thin beams which, owing to their smallness, can be moved or deflected\neasily through the application of low voltages. Since electrostatic forces play\na very major role in maneuvering these devices, a thorough understanding of the\nelectrostatic properties of these structures is of critical importance,\nespecially in the design phase of MEMS. In many cases, the electrostatic\nanalysis of MEMS is carried out using boundary element method (BEM), while the\nstructural analysis is carried out using finite element method (FEM). In this\npaper, we focus on accurate electrostatic analysis of MEMS using BEM. In\nparticular, we consider the problem of computing the charge distribution and\ncapacitance of thin conducting plates relevant to the numerical simulation of\nMEMS. The reason behind the accuracy of the solver is the fact that it uses\nclosed-form analytic expressions that are valid seamlessly throughout the\nphysical domain for computing the influence coefficients.

We discuss simple iterative\nfunction systems of such maps, and show that they lead to self--similar fractal\npatterns on S^2. The final section of this paper is devoted to an informal\ndiscussion of the relations between these concepts and the problems in the\nfoundations of quantum theory, where the interplay between different kinds of\nalgebras and maps may enable us to describe not only the continuous evolution\nof wave functions, but also quantum jumps and \"events\" that accompany these\njumps. Paper dedicated to the memory of Pertti Lounesto.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Apr 2006 13:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
