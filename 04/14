We calculate the surface density\nprofile of the AU Mic disk by performing the inversion of the near-IR and\nvisible scattered light brightness profiles measured by Liu (2004a) and Krist\net al.

The elementary scatterers at visible wavelengths\nare found to be sub-micronic, but the inferred size distribution underestimates\nthe amount of large grains, resulting in too low sub-millimeter emissions\ncompared to the observations. From our inversion procedure, we find that the V-\nto H-band scattering cross sections ratio increases outside 40 AU, in line with\nthe observed color gradient of the disk.

Like some other high-temperature superconductors,\nHg-Ba-Ca-Cu-O exhibits a specific anomaly of the Hall effect, a double-sign\nchange of the Hall coefficient close to the superconducting transition. We have\ninvestigated this phenomenon by measurements of the Hall effect at different\nangles between the magnetic field direction and the crystallographic c-axis.\nThe results concerning the upper part of the transition, where the first sign\nchange occurs, are discussed in terms of the renormalized fluctuation model for\nthe Hall conductivity, adapted through the field rescaling procedure in order\nto take into account the arbitrary orientation of the magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Apr 2006 16:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The calculations were performed using a\nfull-potential linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) method within the so-called\nLSDA+U approach, which adds Hubbard-U correlation effects to specified narrow\nbands in a mean-field approach to the local spin density approximation (LSDA).\nHere both the Gd 4f and 5d states are subject to such corrections. The U(f)\nvalues were determined semi-empirically by using photo-emission and inverse\nphotoemission data for GdP, GdAs, GdSb and GdBi. In contrast to U(f) which\nrepresents narrow band physics, U(d) represents a quasiparticle self-energy\ncorrection of the LSDA gap underestimate. The U(d) value was adjusted using\noptical absorption data for semiconducting GdN above its Curie temperature.\nBelow the Curie temperature, however, in the ferromagnetic state, the gap\nbecomes almost zero. The other Gd pnictides are found to have a small overlap\nof the conduction band at the X point and the valence band at the Gamma point\nin the majority-spin channel. A small gap opens in the spin-minority channel of\nGdP and GdAs, which are thus half-metallic. This spin-minority gap closes in\nsemimetallic GdSb and GdBi. While GdN is found to be ferromagnetic, the other\nGd-pnictides are found to be antiferromagnetic, with ordering along [111]. From\ncalculations with different magnetic configurations, a Heisenberg model with\nfirst and second nearest neighbor exchange parameters is extracted. The\nHeisenberg model is then used to predict Curie-Weiss and N'eel temperatures and\ncritical magnetic fields within mean field and compared with experimental data.\nThe trends are found to be in good agreement with the experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 14:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The coupling of the\nscalar field to a gravitino pair is estimated both in spontaneous and explicit\nsupersymmetry breaking scenarios, with the result that it is proportional to\nthe vacuum expectation value of the scalar field in general. Cosmological\nconstraints depend on whether the gravitino is stable or not, and we study each\ncase separately. For the unstable gravitino with $M_{3/2} \\sim$ 100GeV--10TeV,\nwe obtain not only the upper bound, but also the lower bound on the reheating\ntemperature after the $X$ decay, in order to retain the success of the big-bang\nnucleosynthesis. It is also shown that it severely constrains the decay rate\ninto the gravitino pair. For the stable gravitino, similar but less stringent\nbounds are obtained to escape the overclosure by the gravitinos produced at the\n$X$ decay. The requirement that the free-streaming effect of such gravitinos\nshould not suppress the cosmic structures at small scales eliminates some\nregions in the parameter space, but still leaves a new window of the gravitino\nwarm dark matter. Implications of these results to inflation models are\ndiscussed. In particular, it is shown that modular inflation will face serious\ncosmological difficulty when the gravitino is unstable, whereas it can escape\nthe constraints for the stable gravitino. A similar argument offers a solution\nto the cosmological moduli problem, in which the moduli is relatively heavy\nwhile the gravitino is light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 13:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Furthermore, the\ndimension of narrow-sense BCH codes with small design distance is completely\ndetermined, and - consequently - the bounds on their minimum distance are\nimproved. These results make it possible to determine the parameters of quantum\nBCH codes in terms of their design parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 05:09:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the scheme,\nthe classical simulation of $N$-partical quantum entangled states is generated\nby using $N$ independent classical fields and linear optical elements. Similar\nto the quantum-enhanced measurements, the classical simulation can also achieve\n$\\sqrt{N}$ enhancement over the precision of the measurement $N$ times for\nindependent fields. Due to only using classical fields and linear optical\nelements, the scheme can be realized much more easily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 05:50:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 May 2006 08:45:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 May 2006 06:52:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
