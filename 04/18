This is because the most\ncommonly used mass-loss diagnostics are affected by ``clumping'' (small-scale\ndensity inhomogeneities), influencing our interpretation of observed spectra\nand fluxes. Such downward revisions would have dramatic consequences for the\nevolution of, and feedback from, massive stars, and thus robust determinations\nof the clumping properties and mass-loss rates are urgently needed. Here, we\npresent a first attempt to constrain the radial stratification of the so-called\nclumping factor. To this end, we have analyzed a sample of 19 Galactic O-type\nsupergiants/giants, by combining data for Halpha, IR, mm and radio fluxes, and\nusing appropriate analysis methods. Clumping has been included into our\nanalysis in the ``conventional'' way, by assuming the inter-clump matter to be\nvoid. Because (almost) all our diagnostics depends on the square of density, we\ncannot derive absolute clumping factors, but only factors normalized to a\ncertain minimum. This minimum was usually found to be located in the outermost,\nradio-emitting region, i.e., the radio mass-loss rates are the lowest ones,\ncompared to Mdot derived from Halpha and the IR. The radio rates agree well\nwith those predicted by theory, but are only upper limits, due to unknown\nclumping in the outer wind. Our most important result concerns a (physical)\ndifference between denser and thinner winds: for denser winds, the innermost\nregion is more strongly clumped than the outermost one (with a normalized\nclumping factor of 4.1+/-1.4), whereas thinner winds have similar clumping\nproperties in the inner and outer regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2006 06:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Within the spatially intermittent (SI) class, the temporal behaviour of\nthe burst solutions can be quasi-periodic or travelling wave. The usual\ncharacterizers of bifurcations, i.e. the eigenvalues of the stability matrix\ncrossing the unit circle, pick up the bifurcation from the synchronized\nsolution to SI with quasi-periodic bursts but are unable to pick up the\nbifurcation of the synchronized solution to SI with TW bursts.

The interference\nbetween amplitudes of elastic scattering via a gluon exchange and that of gluon\nradiation reduces the effective elastic energy loss in a finite medium and\ngives rise to a non-trivial length dependence. The reduction is most\nsignificant for a propagation length $L< 4/\\pi T$ in a medium with a\ntemperature $T$. Though the finite size effect is not significant for the\naverage parton propagation in the most central heavy-ion collisions, it will\naffect the centrality dependence of its effect on jet quenching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Apr 2006 22:36:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Sep 2006 02:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

Rev.\nA {\\bf 73}, 042305 (2006)] are recently proposed by Lee, Lim and Yang. In this\npaper we will show that in the two protocols the authenticator Trent should be\nprevented from knowing the secret message of communication. The first protocol\ncan be eavesdropped by Trent using the the intercept-measure-resend attack,\nwhile the second protocol can be eavesdropped by Trent using single-qubit\nmeasurement. To fix these leaks, I revise the original versions of the\nprotocols by using the Pauli-Z operation $\\sigma_z$ instead of the original\nbit-flip operation $X$. As a consequence, the protocol securities are improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Apr 2006 02:06:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2006 13:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
