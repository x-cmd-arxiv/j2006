The focus is on\nthe Thermally-Pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) phase of stellar\nevolution, whose treatment is a source of major discrepancy among different\nevolutionary population synthesis. In particular, besides the models usually\nadopted in the literature, we use models (by Maraston 2005), in which the\ncontribution of the TP-AGB phase is observationally calibrated and is the\ndominant source of near-IR energy for stellar populations in the age range 0.2\nto 2 Gyr.

We find that the\nTP-AGB phase plays a key role in the interpretation of Spitzer data for high-z\ngalaxies, when the rest-frame near-IR is sampled. When fitting without dust\nreddening, the models with the empirically-calibrated TP-AGB phase always\nreproduce better the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs).

In\nboth cases, the results from Maraston models imply younger ages by factors up\nto 6 and lower stellar masses (by ~60 % on average).

An alternative to such\napproaches is to use simple connectivity information, that is, the presence or\nabsence of a link between any pair of nodes, and to extend it to hop-counts, in\norder to obtain an approximate coordinate system. Such an approximation is\nsufficient for a large number of applications, such as routing. In this paper,\nwe propose Jumps, a positioning system for those self-organizing networks in\nwhich other types of (exact) positioning systems cannot be used or are deemed\nto be too costly.

Jumps is interesting in the context of wireless\nsensor networks, as it neither requires additional embedded equipment nor\nrelies on any nodes capabilities.

The phase\nmodulation is achieved by sending two light pulses with a fixed time delay (or\na fixed optical path delay) through a frequency shift element and by modulating\nthe amount of frequency shift. The relative phase between two light pulses upon\nleaving the frequency-shift element is determined by both the time delay (or\nthe optical path delay) and the frequency shift, and can therefore be\ncontrolled by varying the amount of frequency shift.

Both approaches take\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR)-type experiments as the underlying physical\nset-ups to play two-player quantum games. In the first approach, the players'\nstrategies are unit vectors in their respective planes, with the knowledge of\ncoordinate axes being shared between them. Players perform measurements in an\nEPR-type setting and their payoffs are defined as functions of the\ncorrelations, i.e. without reference to classical or quantum mechanics.\nClassical bimatrix games are reproduced if the input states are classical and\nperfectly anti-correlated, as for a classical correlation game. However, for a\nquantum correlation game, with an entangled singlet state as input,\nqualitatively different solutions are obtained. The second approach uses the\nresult that when the predictions of a Local Hidden Variable (LHV) model are\nmade to violate the Bell inequalities the result is that some probability\nmeasures assume negative values. With the requirement that classical games\nresult when the predictions of a LHV model do not violate the Bell\ninequalities, our analysis looks at the impact which the emergence of negative\nprobabilities has on the solutions of two-player games which are physically\nimplemented using the EPR-type experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2006 17:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

{"id":"quant-ph/0604191","submitter":"Huw Price","authors":"Huw Price","title":"Probability in the Everett World: Comments on Wallace and Greaves","comments":"17 pages; no figures; LaTeX","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  It is often objected that the Everett interpretation of QM cannot make sense\nof quantum probabilities, in one or both of two ways: either it can't make\nsense of probability at all, or it can't explain why probability should be\ngoverned by the Born rule. David Deutsch has attempted to meet these\nobjections. He argues not only that rational decision under uncertainty makes\nsense in the Everett interpretation, but also that under reasonable\nassumptions, the credences of a rational agent in an Everett world should be\nconstrained by the Born rule. David Wallace has developed and defended\nDeutsch's proposal, and greatly clarified its conceptual basis. In particular,\nhe has stressed its reliance on the distinguishing symmetry of the Everett\nview, viz., that all possible outcomes of a quantum measurement are treated as\nequally real. The argument thus tries to make a virtue of what has usually been\nseen as the main obstacle to making sense of probability in the Everett world.\nIn this note I outline some objections to the Deutsch-Wallace argument, and to\nrelated proposals by Hilary Greaves about the epistemology of Everettian QM.\n(In the latter case, my arguments include an appeal to an Everettian analogue\nof the Sleeping Beauty problem.) The common thread to these objections is that\nthe symmetry in question remains a very significant obstacle to making sense of\nprobability in the Everett interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Apr 2006 09:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
