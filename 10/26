The current binary population in Sco OB2 is first recovered using two\nadaptive optics surveys (ADONIS, NAOS-CONICA), a literature study, and a\ndetailed analysis of the selection effects of visual, spectroscopic, and\nastrometric binary surveys. Our results indicate a binary fraction close to\n100%. The mass ratio distribution (among A/B primaries) has the form f(q) =\nq^-0.4, while random pairing is excluded. The semi-major axis distribution has\nthe form f(log a) = constant. Due to its youth and low stellar density, the\ncurrent binary population of Sco OB2 is very similar to its primordial binary\npopulation. Our study further indicates a small brown dwarf companion frequency\nand a small substellar-to-stellar companion frequency among A and B type stars.\nThese properties, often referred to as the brown dwarf desert, are a natural\nresult of the mass ratio distribution in Sco OB2. The embryo ejection scenario\nis not necessary to explain observations.

While classical capacity is not enough, a sense of capacity\n(parametrized by reliability) called \"anytime capacity\" is both necessary and\nsufficient for channel evaluation in this context. The rate required is the log\nof the open-loop system gain and the required reliability comes from the\ndesired sense of stability. Sufficiency is maintained even in cases with noisy\nobservations and without any explicit feedback between the observer and the\ncontroller. This established the asymptotic equivalence between scalar\nstabilization problems and delay-universal communication problems with\nfeedback.\n  Here in part II, the vector-state generalizations are established and it is\nthe magnitudes of the unstable eigenvalues that play an essential role.

In general, the longer the\narm length L, the larger the motion the gravitational-wave induces on the test\nmasses, until L becomes comparable to the gravitational wavelength. Recently,\nschemes have been invented, in which displacement noises can be evaded by\nemploying differences between the influence of test-mass motions and that of\ngravitational waves on light propagation.

Use is made of the analytical\nexpressions available in the low temperature regime with focus on the\npossibility of achieving strong dissipation within this approximation. Two\ndifferent types of models are examined: monomial or equivalently chaotic type\npotentials, and hybrid like models where the energy density during inflation is\ndominated by the false vacuum. In both cases dissipation is shown to typically\nincrease during inflation and bring the system into the strong dissipative\nregime. Observational consequences are explored for the amplitude of the\nprimordial spectrum and the spectral index, which translate into constraints on\nthe number of fields mediating the dissipative mechanism, and the number of\nlight degrees of freedom produced during inflation. This paper furthers the\nfoundational development of warm inflation dynamics from first principles\nquantum field theory by calculating conservative lower bound estimates on\ndissipative effects during inflation using the well established thermal\nequilibrium approximation. This approximation does not completely represent the\nactual physical system and earlier work has shown relaxing both the equilibrium\nand low temperature constraints can substantially enlarge the warm inflation\nregime, but these improvements still need further theoretical development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2006 17:36:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The model is the first member of the principal series of the recently\nintroduced logarithmic minimal models. The key to the solution is a functional\nequation in the form of an inversion identity satisfied by the commuting\ndouble-row transfer matrices. This is established directly in the planar\nTemperley-Lieb algebra and holds independently of the space of link states on\nwhich the transfer matrices act. Different sectors are obtained by acting on\nlink states with s-1 defects where s=1,2,3,... is an extended Kac label. The\nbulk and boundary free energies and finite-size corrections are obtained from\nthe Euler-Maclaurin formula. The eigenvalues of the transfer matrix are\nclassified by the physical combinatorics of the patterns of zeros in the\ncomplex spectral-parameter plane. This yields a selection rule for the\nphysically relevant solutions to the inversion identity and explicit finitized\ncharacters for the associated quasi-rational representations. In particular, in\nthe scaling limit, we confirm the central charge c=-2 and conformal weights\nDelta_s=((2-s)^2-1)/8 for s=1,2,3,....

The problem is analyzed by two methods. First, we identify\nstability regions for spatial solitons in the MM system, in terms of the MM\namplitude and period, using the MF equations for spatially-inhomogeneous\nconfigurations. In particular, an instability enclave is found inside the\nstability area.The robustness of the solitons is also tested against variation\nof the shape of the input pulse, and a threshold for the formation of stable\nsolitons is found in terms of its power.

It demonstrates that the MF description is valid\nfor large modulation periods, while at smaller periods the non-MF component\nacquires gain, which implies destruction of MF under the action of the\nhigh-frequency MM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2006 19:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nwater-rock interactions in hydrothermal zones alter the primary minerals\nleading to the formation of secondary minerals. This work addresses the study\nof calcite precipitation in a sand composed of 98% quartz and 2% calcite using\nstreaming potential measurements. The precipitation of calcite as a secondary\nmineral phase, inferred by high calcite saturation indices and by a fall in\npermeability, has a significant effect on the electrokinetic behaviour, leading\nto a significant reduction in the Zeta potential (in absolute value) and even a\nchange in sign. The measured decrease in Zeta potential from -16 mV to\n-27&plusmn;4 mV takes place as the pH rises from 4 to 7, while it remains\nconstant at -25&plusmn;1 mV as the pH increases from 8 to 10.5.

The observed change in sign of the electrical surface potential\nrules out the usual qualitative interpretation of SP anomalies in order to\ndetermine fluid circulations, even at pH lower than 9 if calcite is widely\npresent as a secondary mineral phase, since the electrical surface potential of\ncalcite depends also on CO2 partial pressure and [Ca2+].

In particular, the decaying behavior\nof the LE is found to be controlled by the anisotropy parameter of the spin\nchain. Furthermore, we show that due to the coupling to the spin chain, the\nground-state Berry phase for the central spin becomes nonanalytical and its\nderivative with respect to the magnetic parameter $\\lambda$ in spin chain\ndiverges along the critical line $\\lambda=1$, which suggests an alternative\nmeasurement of the quantum criticality of the spin chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2006 03:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Consider a\nBoolean function $f: \\{0,1\\} \\to \\{0,1\\}$ and suppose that we have a\n(classical) black box to compute it. The problem asks whether $f$ is constant\n(that is, $f(0) = f(1)$) or balanced ($f(0) \\not= f(1)$). Classically, to solve\nthe problem seems to require the computation of $f(0)$ and $ f(1)$, and then\nthe comparison of results. Is it possible to solve the problem with {\\em only\none} query on $f$? In a famous paper published in 1985, Deutsch posed the\nproblem and obtained a ``quantum'' {\\em partial affirmative answer}. In 1998 a\ncomplete, probability-one solution was presented by Cleve, Ekert, Macchiavello,\nand Mosca. Here we will show that the quantum solution can be {\\it\nde-quantised} to a deterministic simpler solution which is as efficient as the\nquantum one. The use of ``superposition'', a key ingredient of quantum\nalgorithm, is--in this specific case--classically available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2006 08:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
