We find\nthat GQ Lup B is somewhat hotter (M6-L0) than reported in the discovery paper\nby Neuhauser and collaborators (M9-L4), mainly due to the surface-gravity\nsensitivity of the K-band spectral classification indices used by the\ndiscoverers. Spectroscopic features characteristic of low surface gravity\nobjects, such as lack of alkali absorption and a triangular H-band continuum,\nare indeed prominent in our spectrum of GQ Lup B. The peculiar shape of the\nH-band continuum and the difference between the two spectral type estimates is\nwell explained in the context of the diminishing strength of H2 collision\ninduced absorption with decreasing surface gravity, as recently proposed for\nyoung ultra-cool dwarfs by Kirkpatrick and collaborators. Using our updated\nspectroscopic classification of GQ Lup B and a re-evaluation of the age and\nheliocentric distance of the primary, we perform a comparative analysis of the\navailable sub-stellar evolutionary models to estimate the mass of the\ncompanion. We find that the mass of GQ Lup B is 0.010-0.040 Msun. Hence, it is\nunlikely to be a wide-orbit counterpart to the known radial-velocity extrasolar\nplanets, whose masses are < 0.015 Msun. Instead, GQ Lup A/B is probably a\nmember of a growing family of very low mass ratio widely separated binaries\ndiscovered through high-contrast imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2006 23:25:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

On average, I Zw 1 is ~35 per cent dimmer in 2005 than in the\nshorter (20 ks) 2002 observation. Between the two epochs the intrinsic\nabsorption column density diminished, but there were also subtle changes in the\ncontinuum shape. Considering the blurred ionised reflection model, the\nlong-term changes can be associated with a varying contribution of the power\nlaw component relative to the total spectrum. Examination of normalised light\ncurves indicates that the high-energy variations are quite structured and that\nthere are delays, but only in some parts of the light curve. Interestingly, a\nhard X-ray lag first appears during the most-distinct structure in the mean\nlight curve, a flux dip ~25 ks into the observation. The previously discovered\nbroad, ionised Fe Ka line shows significant variations over the course of the\n2005 observation. The amplitude of the variations is 25-45 per cent and they\nare unlikely due to changes in the Fe ka-producing region, but perhaps arise\nfrom orbital motion around the black hole or obscuration in the broad iron\nline-emitting region. The 2002 data are re-examined for variability of the Fe\nKa line at that epoch. There is evidence of energy and flux variations that are\nassociated with a hard X-ray flare that occurred during that observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2006 12:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Feb 2007 15:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This scaling issue\nnecessitates a look for new components and principles, as well as mathematical\nanalysis to justify their use. Our approach, like RC4's, is based on rapidly\nmixing random walks on directed graphs (that is, walks which reach a random\nstate quickly, from any starting point). We begin with some well understood\nwalks, and then introduce nonlinearity in their steps in order to improve\nsecurity and show long term statistical correlations are negligible.

Of course, he is most famous for his renormalization theory of\nquantum electrodynamics, for which he shared the Nobel Prize with Richard\nFeynman and Sin-itiro Tomonaga. But although this triumph was undoubtedly his\nmost heroic work, his legacy lives on chiefly through subtle and elegant work\nin classical electrodynamics, quantum variational principles, proper-time\nmethods, quantum anomalies, dynamical mass generation, partial symmetry, and\nmore. Starting as just a boy, he rapidly became the pre-eminent nuclear\nphysicist in the late 1930s, led the theoretical development of radar\ntechnology at MIT during World War II, and then, soon after the war, conquered\nquantum electrodynamics, and became the leading quantum field theorist for two\ndecades, before taking a more iconoclastic route during his last quarter\ncentury.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2006 22:18:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

At the\ninstant they meet, the clocks inside the rockets are set to zero. When they\nreach the targets the rockets meet two clocks A and B whose reading is\nidentical. This question which was tackled in ref [1] is studied here in depth.\nAssuming the existence of a preferred aether frame So in which the one-way\nspeed of light is isotropic, and the anisotropy of this speed in the other\nframes, we show that, if the equal reading of the clocks A and B results from\nan exact synchronization, the clocks inside the rockets will display different\nreadings when they reach A and B in contradiction with the relativity\nprinciple. Conversely, if the clocks A and B, which display an equal reading,\nhave been synchronized by means of the Einstein-Poincare procedure, the inboard\nclocks will also display the same reading, a fact which seems in agreement with\nthe relativity principle. But this synchronization method presupposes the\ninvariance of the one-way speed of light, in contradiction with the assumptions\nmade, and, therefore, introduces a measurement error. This demonstrates that if\nwe assume the existence of an aether frame, the apparent relativity principle\nis not a fundamental principle; it depends on an arbitrary synchronization. In\nany case, this is an example of an experimental measurement which can be\nexplained by aether theory without the assumption of the invariance of the\none-way speed of light in all inertial frames.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2006 13:56:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Mar 2008 17:45:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 14 Dec 2008 18:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-14"}

Varying the relative distance between the ion and the\nmirror, photon correlation statistics can be tuned smoothly from an\nantibunching minimum to a bunching-like maximum. Our analysis concerns the\nnon-Markovian regime of the ion-mirror interaction and reveals the field\nestablishment in a half-cavity interferometer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2006 10:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For this model we propose a method for\nincluding the bias current in the read-out process in a fundamentally\nirreversible way, which to first order, is approximated by the Josephson\njunction tilted-washboard potential phenomenology. The decohering bias current\nis introduced in the form of a Lindblad operator and the Wigner function for\nthe current biased read-out Josephson junction is derived and analyzed. During\nthe read-out current pulse used in the Quantronium experiment we find that the\ncoherence of the qubit initially prepared in a symmetric superposition state is\nlost at a time of 0.2 nanoseconds after the bias current pulse has been\napplied. A timescale which is much shorter than the experimental readout time.\nAdditionally we look at the effect of Johnson-Nyquist noise with zero mean from\nthe current source during the qubit manipulation and show that the decoherence\ndue to the irreversible bias current description is an order of magnitude\nsmaller than that found through adding noise to the reversible tilted washboard\npotential model. Our irreversible bias current model is also applicable to the\npersistent current based qubits where the state is measured according to its\nflux via a small inductance direct current superconducting quantum interference\ndevice (DC-SQUID).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2006 15:34:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
