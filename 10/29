A sensitivity analysis indicates that the intracellular\nconcentration of cholesterol is robust to parametric variations while the\nplasma cholesterol can vary widely. We show how the dynamical response to\ntime-dependent inputs can be used to diagnose the state of the system. We also\nestablish the connection between parameters in the system and medical and\ngenetic conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2006 18:30:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This requirement tightly constrains the possible\nmechanisms. Here we investigate two possible mechanisms for spindle checkpoint\noperation in metazoan cells, both supported by recent experiments. The first\ninvolves the free diffusion and sequestration of cell-cycle regulators. This\nmechanism is severely constrained both by experimental fluorescence recovery\ndata and also by the large volumes involved in open mitosis in metazoan cells.\nUsing a simple mathematical analysis and computer simulation, we find that this\nmechanism can generate the inhibition found in experiment but likely requires a\ntwo stage signal amplification cascade. The second mechanism involves spatial\ngradients of a short-lived inhibitory signal that propagates first by diffusion\nbut then primarily via active transport along spindle microtubules. We propose\nthat both mechanisms may be operative in the metazoan spindle assembly\ncheckpoint, with either able to trigger anaphase onset even without support\nfrom the other pathway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2006 22:37:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
