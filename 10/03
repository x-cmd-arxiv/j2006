Indeed, the relative simplicity of the system\nallows us to interpret more easily the physical phenomenon observed than in\nlarger systems. In order to achieve this goal, non-equilibrium statistical\nmechanics permitted first to develop models based on Langevin equations\ndescribing the dynamics of rotation and translation in double walled nanotubes.\nThe molecular dynamics simulations then permitted to validate these analytical\nmodels, and thus to study general properties of friction such as the dependence\non area of contact, temperature and the geometry of the nanotubes. The results\nobtained shows that friction increases linearly with the sliding velocity or\nthe angular velocity until very high values beyond which non-linearities appear\nenhancing dissipation. In the linear regime, it is shown that the\nproportionality factor between the dynamic friction force and the velocity is\ngiven by the time integral of the autocorrelation function of the restoring\nforce for the sliding friction and of the torque for the rotational friction.\nFurthermore, a novel resonant friction phenomenon increasing significantly\ndissipation was observed for the sliding motion in certain types of nanotubes.\nThe effect arises at sliding velocities corresponding to certain vibrational\nmodes of the nanotubes. When the dynamics is described by the linear friction\nin velocity, the empirical law stating that friction is proportional to the\narea of contact is very well verified thanks to the molecular dynamics\nsimulations. On the other hand, friction increases with temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2006 15:36:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2009 10:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Roughly speaking, given\nthe closure G of an open connected set in R^J, a non-empty convex cone d(x) in\nR^J, specified at each point x on the boundary of G, and a cadlag trajectory\n\\psi taking values in R^J, the ESM defines a constrained version \\phi of \\psi\nthat takes values in G and is such that the increments of \\phi - \\psi on any\ninterval [s,t] lie in the closed convex hull of the directions d(\\phi(u)), u in\n(s,t]. General deterministic properties of the ESP are first established under\nthe only assumption that the graph of d(.) is closed. Next, for a class of\nmulti-dimensional ESPs on polyhedral domains, pathwise uniqueness and existence\nof strong solutions to the associated stochastic differential equations is\nestablished. In addition, it is also proved that these reflected diffusions are\nsemimartingales on [0,\\tau_0], where \\tau_0 is the time to hit the set of\npoints x on the boundary for which d(x) contains a line.
