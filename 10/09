Given the estimated crossing time\nof the Trapezium, it ought to have totally dynamically decayed by now.\nFurthermore, by combining the lower limit of the ONC mass with a standard IMF\nit emerges that the ONC should have formed at least about 40 stars heavier than\n5 M_sun while only ten are observed. Using N-body experiments we (i) confirm\nthe expected instability of the trapezium and (ii) show that beginning with a\ncompact OB-star configuration of about 40 stars the number of observed OB stars\nafter 1 Myr within 1 pc radius and a compact trapezium configuration can both\nbe reproduced.

Results. The spectrum of\nMACHO47.2496.8 is not only dominated by bands of carbon bearing molecules, but\nalso by lines of atomic transitions of s-process elements. The metallicity of\n[Fe/H]=-1.4 is surprisingly low for a field LMC star. The C/O ratio, however\ndifficult to quantify, is greater than 2, and the s-process enrichment is\nlarge: the light s-process elements are enhanced by 1.2 dex compared to iron\n([ls/Fe]=+1.2), while for the heavy s-process elements an even stronger\nenrichment is measured: [hs/Fe]=+2.1.

In the normal state, the temperature (T) dependence of\n1/T^Pr_1T showed almost the same behavior as that for PrOs_4Sb_12 regardless\nof. In contrast, 1/T^La_1T markedly decreases with increasing La concentration.\nIn the superconducting state for x=0.05 and 0.2, 1/T_1^Pr exponentially\ndecreases down to T=0.7 K with no coherence peak below T_c as well as in\nPrOs_4Sb_12. A remarkable finding is that the residual density of states at the\nFermi level below T_c is induced by La substitution for Pr.

The novel strong-coupling superconductivity in\nPrOs_4Sb_12 is inferred to be mediated by the local interaction between\n4f^2-derived crystal-electric-field states with the electric quadrupole degree\nof freedom and conduction electrons. This coupling causes a mass enhancement of\nquasi-particles for a part of FS and induces a small FS, which is responsible\nfor point nodes in the superconducting gap function. Note that the small FS\ndoes not play any primary role for the strong-coupling superconductivity in\nPrOs_4Sb_12.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2006 05:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Due to symmetry reasons there are always two images appearing in the\nreconstruction process. Thus, the reconstructed object is obscured by its\nunwanted out of focus twin image. Especially for emission electron as well as\nfor x- and gamma-ray holography, where the source-object distances are small,\nthe reconstructed images of atoms are very close to their twin images from\nwhich they can hardly be distinguished. In some particular instances only,\nexperimental efforts could remove the twin images. More recently, numerical\nmethods to diminish the effect of the twin image have been proposed but are\nlimited to purely absorbing objects failing to account for phase shifts caused\nby the object. Here we show a universal method to reconstruct a hologram\ncompletely free of twin images disturbance while no assumptions about the\nobject need to be imposed.

The absorption features is studied in two regimes, i)\nthe weak middle transition coupling, i.e.\n  $\\Omega_2 << \\Omega_{1,3}$ and ii) the strong middle transition coupling\n  $\\Omega_2 >>\\Omega_{1,3}$. In case i), it is shown that the ground state\nabsorption and the saturation characteristics of the population of level 2\nreveal deviation due to the presence of upper level couplings. In particular,\nthe saturation curve for the population of level 2 shows a dip for $\\Omega_1 =\n\\Omega_3$. While the populations of levels 3 and 4 show a maxima when this\nresonance condition is satisfied. Thus the resonance condition provides a\ncriterion for maximally populating the upper levels.

In the\nsecond case, I report two important features: a) Filtering of the Aulter-Townes\ndoublet in the three-peak absorption profile of the ground state, which is\nachieved by detuning only the upper most coupling field, and b) control of\nline-width by controlling the strength of the upper coupling fields.
