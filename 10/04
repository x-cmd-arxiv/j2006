Analytic prescriptions are used to incorporate small-scale\nstructures that affect reionization, yet remain unresolved in the N-body\nsimulation.

The detection of planets with the shortest\nknown periods, 1.2 to 2.5 days, has mainly resulted from transit surveys which\nhave generally targeted stars more massive than 0.75 M_sun. Here we report the\nresults from a planetary transit search performed in a rich stellar field\ntowards the Galactic bulge. We discovered 16 candidates with orbital periods\nbetween 0.4 and 4.2 days, five of which orbit stars of 0.44 to 0.75 M_sun. In\ntwo cases, radial-velocity measurements support the planetary nature of the\ncompanions. Five candidates have orbital periods below 1.0 day, constituting a\nnew class of ultra-short-period planets (USPPs), which occur only around stars\nof less than 0.88 M_sun. This indicates that those orbiting very close to more\nluminous stars might be evaporatively destroyed, or that jovian planets around\nlower-mass stars might migrate to smaller radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2006 02:35:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this paper a simple model for the steady state evolution of\ndebris disks due to collisions is developed and confronted with the properties\nof the emerging population of 7 sun-like stars that have hot dust <10AU. The\nmodel shows there is a maximum possible disk mass at a given age, since more\nmassive primordial disks process their mass faster. The corresponding maximum\ndust luminosity is f_max=0.00016r^(7/3)/t_age. The majority (4/7) of the hot\ndisks exceed this limit by >1000 and so cannot be the products of massive\nasteroid belts, rather the following systems must be undergoing transient\nevents characterized by an unusually high dust content near the star: eta\nCorvi, HD69830, HD72905 and BD+20307. It is also shown that the hot dust cannot\noriginate in a recent collision in an asteroid belt, since there is also a\nmaximum rate at which collisions of sufficient magnitude to reproduce a given\ndust luminosity can occur.

The flare\nactivity suggests a quasi-periodicity of ~20 minutes in agreement with previous\nobservations. Aims: By simultaneous fitting of the lightcurve fluctuations and\nthe time-variable polarization angle, we address the question of whether these\nchanges are consistent with a simple hot spot/ring model, in which the\ninterplay of relativistic effects plays the major role, or whether some more\ncomplex dependency of the intrinsic emissivity is required. Methods: We discuss\nthe significance of the 20min peak in the periodogram of a flare from 2003.

We show that, for the same value of the HXR flux, the energy supply\nchanges gradually from its high value (when emitting particle are non-thermal)\nto lower values (when the electrons are thermal). The kinetic equations we use\ninclude terms describing particle thermalization as well as momentum diffusion\ndue to the Fermi II acceleration. We show that the temporal evolution of the\nparticle distribution function has, at its final stationary stage, a rather\nspecific form: it cannot be described by simple exponential or power-law\nexpressions. A broad transfer region is formed by Coulomb collisions at\nenergies between the Maxwellian and power-law parts of the distribution\nfunction. In this region the radiative lifetime of a single electron differs\ngreatly from the lifetime of the distribution function as a whole. For a plasma\ntemperature of 8 keV, the particles emitting bremsstrahlung at 20-80 keV lie in\nthis quasi-thermal regime.

While initial analyses of MR in such\nmultilayers assumed that the direction of the spin of each electron stayed\nfixed as the electron transited the multilayer, we now know that this is true\nonly in a certain limit. Generally, the spins 'flip' in a distance\ncharacteristic of the metal, its purity, and the temperature. They can also\nflip at F/N or N1/N2 interfaces. In this review we describe how to measure the\nlengths over which electron moments flip in pure metals and alloys, and the\nprobability of spin-flipping at metallic interfaces. Spin-flipping within\nmetals is described by a spin-diffusion length,l^M(sf), where the metal M = F\nor N. Spin-diffusion lengths are the characteristic lengths in the\ncurrent-perpendicular-to-plane (CPP) and lateral non-local (LNL) geometries\nthat we focus upon in this review. In certain simple cases, l^N(sf) sets the\ndistance over which the CPP-MR and LNL-MR decrease as the N-layer thickness\n(CPP-MR) or N-film length (LNL) increases, and l^F(sf) does the same for\nincrease of the CPP-MR with increasing F-layer thickness. Spin-flipping at\nM1/M2 interfaces can be described by a parameter, delta(M1/M2), which\ndetermines the spin-flipping probability, P = 1 - exp(-delta).

This model describes\nthe general features of neutrino mixing and relaxation via charged currents in\na medium. The reduced density matrix and the non-equilibrium effective action\nthat describes the propagation of neutrinos is obtained by integrating out the\nbath degrees of freedom. We obtain the dispersion relations, mixing angles and\nrelaxation rates of ``neutrino'' quasiparticles. The dispersion relations and\nmixing angles are of the same form as those of neutrinos in the medium, and the\nrelaxation rates are given by $\\Gamma_1(k) = \\Gamma_{ee}(k)\n\\cos^2\\theta_m(k)+\\Gamma_{\\mu\\mu}(k)\\sin^2\\theta_m(k)\n  ; \\Gamma_2(k)= \\Gamma_{\\mu\\mu}(k)\n\\cos^2\\theta_m(k)+\\Gamma_{ee}(k)\\sin^2\\theta_m(k) $ where\n$\\Gamma_{\\alpha\\alpha}(k)$ are the relaxation rates of the flavor fields in\n\\emph{absence} of mixing, and $\\theta_m(k)$ is the mixing angle in the medium.\nA Weisskopf-Wigner approximation that describes the asymptotic time evolution\nin terms of a non-hermitian Hamiltonian is derived. At long time\n$>>\\Gamma^{-1}_{1,2}$ ``neutrinos'' equilibrate with the bath. The equilibrium\ndensity matrix is nearly diagonal in the basis of eigenstates of an\n\\emph{effective Hamiltonian that includes self-energy corrections in the\nmedium}. The equilibration of ``sterile neutrinos'' via active-sterile mixing\nis discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2006 18:15:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 May 2007 02:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In the final section, revisiting an old idea of Lorentz, we write\nMaxwell's equations for a theory in which the electrostatic force of repulsion\nbetween like charges differs fundamentally in magnitude from the electrostatic\nforce of attraction between unlike charges. We elaborate on Lorentz'\ndescription by means of electric and magnetic field strengths, whose governing\nequations separate into two fully relativistic Maxwell systems--one describing\nordinary electromagnetism, and the other describing a universally attractive or\nrepulsive long-range force. If such a force cannot be ruled out {\\it a priori}\nby known physical principles, its magnitude should be determined or bounded\nexperimentally. Were it to exist, interesting possibilities go beyond Lorentz'\nearly conjecture of a relation to (Newtonian) gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Oct 2006 19:58:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Dec 2006 19:21:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
