Most other variations are linked to the intrinsic variability of the\ncomet. The Odin satellite monitored nearly continuously the H_2O line at 557\nGHz during the 38 hours following the impact on the 4th of July, in addition to\nweekly monitoring.

A key feature of STM is to provide a way\nto group sequences of read and write actions inside atomic blocks, similar to\ndatabase transactions, whose whole effect should occur atomically. In this\npaper, we investigate STM from a process algebra perspective and define an\nextension of asynchronous CCS with atomic blocks of actions. Our goal is not\nonly to set a formal ground for reasoning on STM implementations but also to\nunderstand how this model fits with other concurrency control mechanisms. We\nalso view this calculus as a test bed for extending process calculi with atomic\ntransactions. This is an interesting direction for investigation since, for the\nmost part, actual works that mix transactions with process calculi consider\ncompensating transactions, a model that lacks all the well-known ACID\nproperties. We show that the addition of atomic transactions results in a very\nexpressive calculus, enough to easily encode other concurrent primitives such\nas guarded choice and multiset-synchronization (\\`{a} la join-calculus). The\ncorrectness of our encodings is proved using a suitable notion of bisimulation\nequivalence. The equivalence is then applied to prove interesting ``laws of\ntransactions'' and to obtain a simple normal form for transactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2006 08:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We give a collection of Feynman rules\nincluding v^2/f^2 contributions that are presented here for the first time and\ncould turn out to be useful also for applications outside flavour physics. We\nadopt a model-independent parameterization of rare decays in terms of the gauge\nindependent functions X_i,Y_i,Z_i (i=K,d,s), which is in particular useful for\nthe study of the breaking of the universality between K, B_d and B_s systems\nthrough non-MFV interactions. Performing the calculation in the unitary and 't\nHooft-Feynman gauge, we find that the final result contains a divergence which\nsignals some sensitivity to the ultraviolet completion of the theory. Including\nan estimate of this contribution, we calculate the branching ratios for the\ndecays $K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu$, $K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu$, $B_{s,d}\\to\n\\mu^+\\mu^-$, $B\\to X_{s,d}\\nu\\bar\\nu$, $K_L \\to\\pi^0\\ell^+\\ell^-$ and $B\\to\nX_{s,d}\\ell^+\\ell^-$, paying particular attention to non-MFV contributions\npresent in the model.\n  Imposing all available constraints we find that the decay rates for $B_{s,d}\n\\to \\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and $B \\to X_{s,d} \\nu \\bar \\nu$ can be enhanced by at most\n50% and 35% relative to the SM values, while $Br(K^+\\to\\pi^+\\nu\\bar\\nu)$ and\n$Br(K_L\\to\\pi^0\\nu\\bar\\nu)$ can be both as high as $5 \\cdot 10^{-10}$.\nSignificant enhancements of the decay rates $K_L \\to\\pi^0\\ell^+\\ell^-$ are also\npossible.

The proof also applies to the case where\nthe key is encoded in the photon polarization of a weak coherent-state pulse\nwith a known phase, but only if the phases of the four BB84 signal states are\njudiciously chosen. The achievable key generation rate scales quadratically\nwith the transmission in the channel, just as for BB84 with phase-randomized\nweak coherent-state signals (when decoy states are not used).

At any boundstate energy the Schroedinger\nequation has two linearly independent solutions one of which is normalisable\nwhile the other is not. In the domain after the last node of a boundstate\neigenfunction the unnormalisable linearly independent solution has a simple\nform which enables the construction of functions analogous to Green's functions\nthat lead to certain sum rules. One set of sum rules give conditions that must\nbe satisfied at the nodes and extrema of the boundstate eigenfunctions of\nconfining potentials. Another sum rule establishes a relation between an\nintegral involving an eigenfunction in the domain after the last node and a sum\ninvolving all the eigenvalues and eigenstates.
