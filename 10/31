Since this model is energetically difficult, we propose that\nthe radio afterglow is produced by a non-relativistic phase of an initially\ncollimated outflow (jet).

The collimation-corrected event rate of\nsuch low-luminosity GRBs is estimated to be ~ 10 times higher than that of\ntypical long GRBs, and they might form a different GRB population:\nlow-luminosity GRBs are produced by mildly-relativistic jets from neutron stars\nat the collapses of massive stars, while typical long GRBs by\nhighly-relativistic jets from black holes.

Chandra observations of NGC 5746\nreveal evidence for diffuse X-ray emission with a total luminosity of ~7 x\n10^39 erg/s surrounding this galaxy out to at least ~20 kpc from the disk,\nwhereas an identical study of the less massive NGC 5170 fails to detect any\nextraplanar X-ray emission. Unlike the case for other disk galaxies with\ndetected X-ray halos, the halo emission around NGC 5746 is not accompanied by\nextraplanar H-alpha or radio emission, and there is no evidence for significant\nnuclear or starburst activity in the disk. In contrast to these other cases,\nthe emission around NGC 5746 therefore appears to arise from the cooling of\nexternally accreted material rather than from disk outflows. To verify this\nidea, we present results of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and\nevolution, showing our observations to be in good agreement with expectations\nfor cosmological accretion, while also confirming that the X-ray halos of other\nspirals do not fit well into an accretion scenario.

Analysis of this cold front indicates NGC4783 is moving east\nwith a total velocity ~870+270-400 km/s (Mach ~1.4+0.5-0.7) at an inclination\nangle ~46 deg.(>33 deg.)towards us with respect to theplane of the sky. A\n~45Myr old X-ray cavity, with enthalpy of 4.4 x 10^{57}ergs, coincides with the\neastern radio lobe of 3C278. X-ray knots are found on both the radio jet and\ncounter-jet, coincident with peaks in the radio emission. Assuming a light,\nmildly relativistic jet in 3C278, ram pressure velocities of 100-200 km/s\nimpacting the eastern jet and ~170 km/s acting on the western radio lobe are\nsufficient to produce their observed bending. These velocities may be caused by\nbulk motions established in the IGM by the high velocity interaction between\nthe galaxies, by the motion of NGC4782 relative to the IGM, or both.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2006 18:45:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Apr 2007 17:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The pulse energy time series are analysed to derive improved\nstatistics of nulling pulses as well as to investigate the frequency dependence\nof the phenomenon. The pulsar is observed to be in null state for approximately\n15% of the time; however, we find that nulling does not always occur\nsimultaneously at all four frequencies of observation. We characterise this\n\"selective nulling'' as a function of frequency, separation in frequency, and\ncombination of frequencies. The most remarkable case is a significantly large\nnumber of nulls ($\\approx$6%) at lower frequencies, that are marked by the\npresence of a fairly narrow emission feature at the highest frequency of 4850\nMHz.

The question remains as to whether the broadening of the\nhigh-energy end of the observed nonthermal spectrum of SNRs, like in G347.3-0.5\nand SN 1006, can be an artifact of observations or it is a consequence of the\nmicrophysics involved in the acceleration process. In this note we study the\ninfluence of parameters variations (inside the volume and over the surface of\nSNR) on the shape of the high-energy end of the synchrotron (and also inverse\nCompton) spectrum. We consider three possibilities for these parameter\nvariations: i) gradients downstream of the shock with constant maximum energy\nof the accelerated electrons and the potential variation in time of the\ninjection efficiency, ii) then we add the possibility of the maximum energy\ndepending on time, and finally iii) the possible obliquity dependences of\nmaximum energy and injection efficiency. It is shown that gradients of density\nand magnetic field strength downstream of the shock are ineffective in\nmodifying the shape of the synchrotron spectrum, even if an SNR evolves in the\nnonuniform interstellar medium and/or the injection efficiency varies in time.\nThe time dependence of the maximum energy of the electrons accelerated by the\nshock is also not able to make the observed spectrum much broader. The only\npossibility of producing considerable broadening in the spectrum is the\nvariation in the maximum energy of electrons over the surface of SNR. In such a\ncase, the obliquity dependence of the injection efficiency also affects the\nshape of the spectrum, but its role is less significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2006 10:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The large body of observational\nresults collected by soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (2-10 keV) X-ray surveys are\nused to constrain at best the properties of the Compton-thin AGN population and\nits contribution to the XRB emission. The number ratio R between moderately\nobscured (Compton-thin) AGN and unobscured AGN is fixed by the comparison\nbetween the soft and hard XLFs, which suggests that R decreases from 4 at low\nluminosities to 1 at high luminosities. From the same comparison there is no\nclear evidence of an evolution of the obscured AGN fraction with redshift. The\ndistribution of the absorbing column densities in obscured AGN is determined by\nmatching the soft and hard source counts. A distribution rising towards larger\ncolumn densities is able to reproduce the soft and hard AGN counts over about 6\ndex in flux. The model also reproduces with excellent accuracy the fraction of\nobscured objects in AGN samples selected at different X-ray fluxes. The\nintegrated emission of the Compton-thin AGN population is found to\nunderestimate the XRB flux at about 30 keV and a population of heavily obscured\n-Compton-thick- AGN, as large as that of moderately obscured AGN, is required\nto fit the residual background emission.

Here we generalize the topology from\nall-to-all to a regular one of a two-dimensional triangular lattice. The\ndriving force in this dynamics is the reduction of frustrated triads in order\nto reach a balanced state. The dynamics is parameterized by a so-called\npropensity parameter $p$ that determines the tendency of negative links to\nbecome positive. As a function of $p$ we find a phase transition between\ndifferent kind of absorbing states. The phases differ by the existence of an\ninfinitely connected (percolated) cluster of negative links that forms whenever\n$p\\leq p_c$. Moreover, for $p\\leq p_c$, the time to reach the absorbing state\ngrows powerlike with the system size $L$, while it increases logarithmically\nwith $L$ for $p > p_c$. From a finite-size scaling analysis we numerically\ndetermine the critical exponents $\\beta$ and $\\nu$ together with $\\gamma$,\n$\\tau$, $\\sigma$. The exponents satisfy the hyperscaling relations. We also\ndetermine the fractal dimension $d_f$ that fulfills a hyperscaling relation as\nwell. The transition of triad dynamics between different absorbing states\nbelongs to a universality class with new critical exponents. We generalize the\ntriad dynamics to four-cycle dynamics on a square lattice.

Newman claimed that a general network-based\nstochastic Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) epidemic model is isomorphic to\na bond percolation model, where the bonds are the edges of the contact network\nand the bond occupation probability is equal to the marginal probability of\ntransmission from an infected node to a susceptible neighbor. In this paper, we\nshow that this isomorphism is incorrect and define a semi-directed random\nnetwork we call the epidemic percolation network that is exactly isomorphic to\nthe SIR epidemic model in any finite population. In the limit of a large\npopulation, (i) the distribution of (self-limited) outbreak sizes is identical\nto the size distribution of (small) out-components, (ii) the epidemic threshold\ncorresponds to the phase transition where a giant strongly-connected component\nappears, (iii) the probability of a large epidemic is equal to the probability\nthat an initial infection occurs in the giant in-component, and (iv) the\nrelative final size of an epidemic is equal to the proportion of the network\ncontained in the giant out-component. For the SIR model considered by Newman,\nwe show that the epidemic percolation network predicts the same mean outbreak\nsize below the epidemic threshold, the same epidemic threshold, and the same\nfinal size of an epidemic as the bond percolation model. However, the bond\npercolation model fails to predict the correct outbreak size distribution and\nprobability of an epidemic when there is a nondegenerate infectious period\ndistribution.

Linear algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) are\nused almost exclusively for this purpose. However, biological systems tend to\npossess nonlinearities and operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales so\nthat the set of reachable system states typically does not lie close to a\nsingle linear subspace. We compare the performance of PCA to two alternative\nnonlinear algorithms (Isomap and our novel pointwise dimension estimation\n(PD-E)) using synthetic and motion capture data from a robotic arm with known\nkinematic dimensions, as well as motion capture data from human hands. We find\nthat consideration of the spectral properties of the singular value\ndecomposition in PCA can lead to more accurate dimension estimates than the\ndominant practice of using a fixed variance capture threshold. We investigate\nmethods for identifying a single integer dimension using PCA and Isomap. In\ncontrast, PD-E provides a range of estimates of fractal dimension. This helps\nto identify heterogeneous geometric structure of data sets such as unions of\nmanifolds of differing dimensions, to which Isomap is less sensitive. Contrary\nto common opinion regarding fractal dimension methods, PD-E yielded reasonable\nresults with reasonable amounts of data. We conclude that it is necessary and\nfeasible to complement PCA with other methods that take into consideration the\nnonlinear properties of biological systems for a more robust estimation of\ntheir degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2006 20:29:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
