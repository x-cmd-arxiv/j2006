To construct this system we statistically analyse a sample of >22,000\ngalaxies at v<15,000 km/s (z<0.05) with Spearman rank and principal component\nanalyses. Fourteen major galaxy properties are considered, including: Hubble\ntype, size, colour, surface brightness, magnitude, stellar mass, internal\nvelocities, HI gas content, and an index that measures dynamical disturbances.\nWe find, to a high degree, that most galaxy properties are correlated, with in\nparticular Hubble type, colour, and stellar mass all strongly related. We argue\nthat this tight 3-way correlation is a result of evolutionary processes that\ndepend on galaxy mass, as we show that the relation between colour and mass is\nindependent of Hubble type. Various principal component analyses reveal that\nmost of the variation in nearby galaxy properties can be accounted for by\neigenvectors dominated by: (i) the scale of a galaxy, such as its stellar mass,\n(ii) the spectral type, and (iii) the degree of dynamical disturbances. We\nsuggest that these three properties: mass, star formation, and\ninteractions/mergers are the major features that determine a galaxy's physical\nstate, and should be used to classify galaxies. As shown in Conselice (2003),\nthese properties are measurable within the CAS (concentration, asymmetry,\nclumpiness) structural system, thus providing an efficient mechanism for\nclassifying galaxies in optical light within a physical meaningful framework.\nWe furthermore discuss the fraction and number density of galaxies in the\nnearby universe as a function of Hubble type, for comparison with higher\nredshift populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2006 21:44:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Nov 2006 19:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A key aspect of the\ncollisional evolution is the coupling between dust and gas motions, which\ndepends on the internal structure (porosity) of aggregates. Aims: To quantify\nthe importance of the internal structure on the collisional evolution of\nparticles, and to create a new coagulation model to investigate the difference\nbetween porous and compact coagulation in the context of a turbulent\nprotoplanetary disk. Methods: We have developed simple prescriptions for the\ncollisional evolution of porosity of grain-aggregates in grain-grain\ncollisions. Three regimes can then be distinguished: `hit-and-stick' at low\nvelocities, with an increase in porosity; compaction at intermediate\nvelocities, with a decrease of porosity; and fragmentation at high velocities.\n(..) Results: (..) We can discern three different stages in the particle growth\nprocess (..) We find that when compared to standard, compact models of\ncoagulation, porous growth delays the onset of settling, because the surface\narea-to-mass ratio is higher, a consequence of the build-up of porosity during\nthe initial stages. As a result, particles grow orders of magnitudes larger in\nmass before they rain-out to the mid-plane. Depending on the turbulent\nviscosity and on the position in the nebula, aggregates can grow to (porous)\nsizes of ~ 10 cm in a few thousand years. We also find that collisional\nenergies are higher than in the limited PCA/CCA fractal models, thereby\nallowing aggregates to restructure. It is concluded that the microphysics of\ncollisions plays a key role in the growth process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2006 12:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The observed velocity-averaged line ratios are well reproduced by\nshocks with speeds v_s larger than ~ 30 km/s and densities ~ 10^{5} - 10^{6}\ncm^{-3}. Plane-parallel shock models, however, fail to predict all the observed\nline profiles and in particular the very similar profiles shown by both low and\nhigh excitation lines. The overall observations support the idea that the L1157\nclumps are shock interaction events older than the L1448 bullets close to the\ndriving source. In the latter objects, the velocity structure and the\nvariations of physical parameters with the velocity resemble very closely those\nfound in optical/IR jets near the protostar, suggesting that similar launching\nand excitation mechanisms are also at the origin of collimated jets seen at\nmillimetre wavelengths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2006 13:14:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We find a\npossible explanation for some experiments observing a slip length depending on\nthe flow velocity which is contradictory to many theoretical results and\nsimulations. Our explanation is that a velocity dependent slip can be detected\nif the flow profile is not fully developed within the channel, but in a\ntransient state.\n  Further, we show a decrease of the measured slip length with increasing\nviscosity and demonstrate the effect of adding surfactant to a fluid flow in a\nhydrophobic microchannel.

By working from a first order\nvariational principle and performing the corresponding Dirac analysis we find\nthat the standard electro-magnetic duality can be reformulated as a canonical\nlocal transformation. The reduction from this phase space to the original phase\nspace variables coincides with the well known result about duality as a\ncanonical non local transformation.

These Dualities are not canonical transformations for the Dirac\nbracket and relate actions with different kinetic terms in the reduced space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2006 01:59:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

We show two more evident\nmathematical reasons why such indefinite metric appears. The first idea is the\nreplacement of involution on an algebra. For an algebra ${\\cal A}$ with an\ninvolution $\\sdag$ such that a representation of the involutive algebra $({\\cal\nA},\\sdag)$ brings an indefinite-metric space, we replace the involution $\\sdag$\nwith a new one * on ${\\cal A}$ such that $({\\cal A},*)$ is a well-known\ninvolutive algebra acting on a representation space with positive definite\nmetric. This explains that non-isomorphic two involutive algebras are\ntransformed each other by the replacement of involution. The second is that a\ncovariant (Hilbert space) representation $({\\cal H},\\pi,U)$ of an involutive\ndynamical system $(({\\cal A},*),{\\bf Z}_{2},\\alpha)$ brings a Krein space\nrepresentation of the algebra ${\\cal A}$ with the replaced involution.

Afterwards I got the impression that I had not succeeded in making\nmy points clear. Therefore, I wrote an explanatory letter to Prof. von\nWeizsaecker. This was the beginning of a correspondence on the questions\nintimated by the title above. In addition, a private discussion between Prof.\nvon Weizsaecker and myself took place. Some readers may be interested in the\nanswers which Carl Friedrich von Weizsaecker has given to the naive questions\nand views of a physicist with only a rudimentary education in philosophy. The\nstarting point of our discussion was my remark that the conspicuous inability\nof philosophers to agree on the deepest elements of human existence including\nthe basic questions of ethics, which is tantamount to the occurrence of\ndifferent schools of philosophy competing with each other, could perhaps be\ntraced back to the fundamental inability of man to attain self-knowledge.\nPhysicists, on the other hand, can reach consent, in an equally remarkable way,\non the results of their measurements and on whether or not these results agree\nwith the ideas of theory. They just have to deal with res extensa. Here the\nyardstick does not intend to measure itself, but objects which are external to\nit, and this is possible. There remains only the question what consequences can\nbe drawn from this realization. Is philosophy, in as much as it gives\nstatements on the totality of human existence, only an expression of the\nprevailing social circumstances and views, interesting enough as such, but not\na gateway to truth?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2006 14:40:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

If it is assumed that urchins are asocial, and that\nthey move randomly, then the formation of these dense fronts is an apparent\nparadox. The key lies in observations that urchins move further in areas where\ntheir algal food is less plentiful. This naturally leads to the accumulation of\nurchins in areas with abundant algae. If urchin movement is represented as a\nrandom walk, with a step size that depends on algal concentration, then their\nmovement may be described by a Fokker-Planck diffusion equation. For certain\ncombinations of algal growth and urchin grazing, travelling wave solutions are\nobtained. Two dimensional simulations of urchin algal dynamics show that an\ninitially uniformly distributed urchin population, grazing on an alga with a\nsmoothly varying density, may form a propagating front separating two sharply\ndelineated regions. On one side of the front algal density is uniformly low,\nand on the other side of the front algal density is uniformly high. Bounds on\nwhen stable fronts will form are obtained in terms of urchin density and\ngrazing, and algal growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2006 01:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
