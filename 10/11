The analysis is organized\ninto two parts. In the first part, the impact of system parameters on the OFDM\nDLC is analyzed in a general setting. The main results are that under weak\nassumptions the maximum achievable single user DLC is almost independent of the\ndistribution of the path attenuations in the low signal-to-noise (SNR) region\nbut depends strongly on the delay spread. In the high SNR region the roles are\nexchanged. Here, the impact of delay spread is negligible while the impact of\nthe distribution becomes dominant. The relevant asymptotic quantities are\nderived without employing simplifying assumptions on the OFDM correlation\nstructure. Moreover, for both cases it is shown that the DLC is maximized if\nthe total channel energy is uniformly spread, i.e. the power delay profile is\nuniform. It is worth pointing out that since universal bounds are obtained the\nresults can also be used for other classes of parallel channels with block\nfading characteristic. The second part extends the setting to the broadcast\nchannel and studies the corresponding OFDM DLC BC region. An algorithm for\ncomputing the OFDM BC DLC region is presented. To derive simple but smart\nresource allocation strategies, the principle of rate water-filling employing\norder statistics is introduced. This yields analytical lower bounds on the OFDM\nDLC region based on orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and\nordinal channel state information (CSI). Finally, the schemes are compared to\nan algorithm using full CSI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2006 10:42:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

In these proceedings I will argue that axinos\ncan be successful Cold Dark Matter candidates in models with Supersymmetry and\nthe Peccei-Quinn solution of the strong CP problem. If they are the Lightest\nSupersymmetric Particle (LSP), they can be produced in the right abundance by\nthermal scatterings and out of equilibrium decays of the Next-to-Lightest\nSupersymmetric Particles (NLSPs). Moreover if the NLSPs are charged, their\ndecay could help us understand which is the LSP, e.g. between axino and\ngravitino.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Oct 2006 17:53:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We determine explicit expressions for soft terms for the\nsingle-modulus KKLT scenario and the multiple-moduli large volume scenario. In\nparticular we use the chiral matter metrics for Calabi-Yau backgrounds recently\ncomputed in hep-th/0609180. These differ from the better understood metrics for\nnon-chiral matter and therefore give a different structure of soft terms. The\nsoft terms take a simple form depending explicitly on the modular weights of\nthe corresponding matter fields. For the large-volume case we find that in the\nsimplest D7 brane configuration, scalar masses, gaugino masses and A-terms are\nvery similar to the dilaton-dominated scenario. Although all soft masses are\nsuppressed by ln(M_P/m_{3/2}) compared to the gravitino mass, the\nanomaly-mediated contributions do not compete, being doubly suppressed and thus\nsubdominant to the gravity-mediated tree-level terms. Soft terms are\nflavour-universal to leading order in an expansion in inverse Kahler moduli.\nThey also do not introduce extra CP violating phases to the effective action.\nWe argue that soft term flavour universality should be a property of the\nlarge-volume compactifications, and more generally IIB flux models, in which\nflavour is determined by the complex structure moduli while supersymmetry is\nbroken by the Kahler moduli. For the simplest large-volume case we run the soft\nterms to low energies and present some sample spectra and a basic\nphenomenological analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2006 15:38:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2006 11:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

The entire\narticle follows as it should have appeared. IMS apologizes to the author and\nthe readers for this error. A recent paper by Harrison and Van Mieghem\nexplained in general mathematical terms how one forms an ``equivalent workload\nformulation'' of a Brownian network model. Denoting by $Z(t)$ the state vector\nof the original Brownian network, one has a lower dimensional state descriptor\n$W(t)=MZ(t)$ in the equivalent workload formulation, where $M$ can be chosen as\nany basis matrix for a particular linear space. This paper considers Brownian\nmodels for a very general class of open processing networks, and in that\ncontext develops a more extensive interpretation of the equivalent workload\nformulation, thus extending earlier work by Laws on alternate routing problems.\nA linear program called the static planning problem is introduced to articulate\nthe notion of ``heavy traffic'' for a general open network, and the dual of\nthat linear program is used to define a canonical choice of the basis matrix\n$M$. To be specific, rows of the canonical $M$ are alternative basic optimal\nsolutions of the dual linear program. If the network data satisfy a natural\nmonotonicity condition, the canonical matrix $M$ is shown to be nonnegative,\nand another natural condition is identified which ensures that $M$ admits a\nfactorization related to the notion of resource pooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2006 06:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
