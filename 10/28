We confirm that significant differential\nrotation results even when the rotation of the progenitor is initially uniform.\nConsequently, the magnetic field is amplified both by magnetic winding and the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI).

Following\nPNS formation, MHD outflows lead to losses of rest mass, energy, and angular\nmomentum from the system. The earliest outflow is produced primarily by the\nincreasing magnetic stress caused by magnetic winding. The MRI amplifies the\npoloidal field and increases the magnetic stress, causing further angular\nmomentum transport and helping to drive the outflow. After the magnetic field\nsaturates, a nearly stationary, collimated magnetic field forms near the\nrotation axis and a Blandford-Payne type outflow develops along the field\nlines. These outflows remove angular momentum from the PNS at a rate given by\n\\dot{J} \\sim \\eta E_EM C_B, where \\eta is a constant of order 0.1 and C_B is a\ntypical ratio of poloidal to toroidal field strength. As a result, the rotation\nperiod quickly increases for a strongly magnetized PNS until the degree of\ndifferential rotation decreases.

Based upon the proposal, we investigated\nsystematically the relaxed lattice configuration for narrow SWCNT's, the strain\nenergy, the Young's modulus and Poisson ratio, and the lattice vibrational\nproperties respected to the relaxed equilibrium tubule structure. Our\ncalculated results for various physical quantities are nicely in consistency\nwith existing experimental measurements. Particularly, we verified that the\nrelaxation effect brings the bond length longer and the frequencies of various\noptical vibrational modes softer; Our calculation provides the evidence that\nthe Young's modulus of armchair tube exceeds that of the planar graphene sheet,\nand the large diameter limits of the Young's modulus and Poisson ratio are in\nagreement with the experimental values of the graphite; The calculated radial\nbreathing modes for the ultra narrow tubes with diameter range between 0.2 -\n0.5 nm coincide the experimental results and the existing {\\it ab initio}\ncalculations with satisfaction; For narrow tubes of diameter 2 nm, the\ncalculated frequencies of optical modes in tubule tangential plane as well as\nthose of radial breathing modes are also in good agreement with the\nexperimental measurement. In addition, our calculation shows that various\nphysical quantities of relaxed SWCNT's can actually be expanded in terms of the\nchiral angle defined for the correspondent ideal SWCNT's.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2006 03:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Apr 2007 15:59:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-10"}

An approximate analytic solution has been given for the\ncoupled Maxwell-Lorentz equations describing the dynamics of the surface\ncurrent and the composite radiation field. The nonlinearities stemming from the\nrelativistics kinematics of free electrons lead to the appearance of\nhigher-harmonics in the scattered spectra. In our analysis particular attention\nhas been paid to the effect of the carrier-envelope phase difference of the\nincoming laser pulse. For the fourth harmonic peak we calculated almost 25\npercent modulation. In general, the harmonic peaks are down-shifted due to\npresence of the intensity-dependent factors by an order of 15-65 percent in\ncase of an incoming field of intensity we have discussed. The spectrum of the\nhigh-harmonics has a long tail where the heights of the peaks vary within one\norder of magnitude forming a quasi-continuum. By Fourier synthetising the field\ncomponents of this plateau region attosecond pulses have been obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2006 17:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}
