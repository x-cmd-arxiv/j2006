We discuss the\nisotopic compositions of presolar spinel grain OC2 and compare them to\ntheoretical predictions. We show that the isotopic composition of O, Mg and Al\nin OC2 could be the signature of an AGB star of IM and metallicity close to\nsolar experiencing hot bottom burning, or of an AGB star of low mass (LM) and\nlow metallicity suffering very efficient cool bottom processing. Large\nmeasurement uncertainty in the Fe isotopic composition prevents us from\ndiscriminating which model better represents the parent star of OC2. However,\nthe Cr isotopic composition of the grain favors an origin in an IM-AGB star of\nmetallicity close to solar. Our IM-AGB models produce a self-consistent\nsolution to match the composition of OC2 within the uncertainties related to\nreaction rates. Within this solution we predict that the 16O(p,g)17F and the\n17O(p,a)14N reaction rates should be close to their lower and upper limits,\nrespectively. By finding more grains like OC2 and by precisely measuring their\nFe and Cr isotopic compositions, it may be possible in the future to derive\nconstraints on massive AGB models from the study of presolar grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2006 11:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Our goal is to\ndetermine light curves and period-luminosity (PL) relations in the near-IR, to\nassess the similarity between cluster and field pulsators, and to examine the\npredictive capability of current pulsation models. The light curves are\nobtained from multiwavelength broadband J,H,Ks photometry of Cepheids in both\nclusters, with periods previously established from optical photometry.

Cluster and field Cepheids are homogeneous and the\ninclusion of the cluster Cepheids in the field sample extends nicely the PL\nrelation.

As a result, in the lowest order (i) the\ninterference of amplitudes in the $\\nu_e - \\nu_\\mu$ $(\\nu_\\tau)$ transition\nprobability is absent; (ii) dependence of the probability on the CP-phase,\n$\\delta$, as well as on $\\theta_{12}$ and $\\Delta m^2_{21}$ disappears.\nCorrections to the equality $L_{magic} = l_0$ are estimated.

We demonstrate here that a\nslow-velocity excited particle tunnels freely through a vacuum electromagnetic\nfield mode filled with $N-1$ ground state atoms. The reason for this is the\ntrapping of the moving atom into its upper state due to multiparticle\ninfluences and the corresponding decoupling from the interaction with the\nenvironment such that the emitter does not {\\it see} the induced potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2006 10:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
