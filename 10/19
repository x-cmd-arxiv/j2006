The motivation for such an\nanalysis and a further result is the fact that a unitary transformation of this\nkind arises naturally in scattering theory on non-stationary backgrounds.\nIndeed, employing the perturbation theory of the Yang-Feldman equations with a\nfree CCR field in a quasifree state as an initial condition and making use of\nextended Feynman graphs, we are able to calculate the Wightman functions of the\ninteracting and outgoing fields in a $\\phi^p$-theory on arbitrary curved\nspacetimes. A further examination then reveals two major features of the\naforementioned theory: firstly, the interacting Wightman functions fulfil the\nbasic axioms of hermiticity, invariance, spectrality (on stationary\nspacetimes), perturbative positivity, and locality. Secondly, the outgoing\nfield is free and fulfils the CCR, but is in general not in a quasifree state\nin the case of a non-stationary spacetime. In order to obtain a sensible\nparticle picture for the outgoing field and, hence, a description of the\nscattering process in terms of particles (in asymptotically flat spacetimes),\nit is thus necessary to compute a unitary transformation of the abovementioned\ntype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2006 12:45:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2006 20:57:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2006 21:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2009 18:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-15"}

The\nproblem is motivated by switching measurements on superconducting Josephson\njunctions. In this quantum mechanical experiment, the sequences of current\npulses are applied to the Josephson junction sample and a binary response\nindicating the presence or the absence of a voltage response is measured. The\nbinary response can be modeled by a generalized linear model with the\ncomplementary log-log link function. The other models considered are the logit\nmodel and the probit model. For these three models, the approximately optimal\nsample size for the next stage as a function of the current Fisher information\nand the stage cost is determined. The cost-efficiency of the proposed design is\ndemonstrated in simulations based on real data from switching measurements. The\nresults can be directly applied to switching measurements and they may lead to\nsubstantial savings in the time needed for the experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2006 06:53:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 2008 09:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-08"}

Moreover, in many applications, the state variables are not\nobservable; instead, some functions of the states can be observed. How to\nsynchronize coupled systems with the observed data is of great significance. In\nthis paper, synchronization of nonlinearly coupled chaotic systems with an\nadaptive coupling strength is also discussed. The validity of those schemes are\nproved rigorously.

The use of bright pulses leads to a high success\nprobability for the generation of entanglement, at the cost of a lower initial\nfidelity.

The need for more purification\nsteps is well compensated for by the increased probability of success when\ncompared to heralded entanglement schemes using single photons or weak coherent\npulses with realistic detectors.
