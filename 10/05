All\nof the 169 previously known PNe within this region have also been independently\nrecovered and included in this paper to create a homogeneous data set. Of the\nnewly discovered PNe, we classify 291 as \"true\", 54 as \"likely\" and 115 as\n\"possible\" based on the strength of photometric and spectroscopic evidence.\nRadial velocities have been measured using both weighted averaging of emission\nlines and cross-correlation techniques against high quality templates. Based on\nthe median comparison of the two systems, we define a measurement error of pm4\nkm/s. A new velocity map of the central 25 sq deg of the LMC, based on results\nfrom the combined new and previously known PNe, is presented, indicating an\naveraged heliocentric velocity differential of 65 km/s perpendicular to the\nline of nodes for the entire PN population across our survey area. Averaged\nvelocities of our PNe and molecular hydrogen (from the literature) across 37 x\n37 arcmin sub areas are compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2006 13:04:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Oct 2006 23:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Dec 2006 11:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Our discussion is based on the observationaly\ninfered fact that, as the pulsar spins down, the region of closed corotating\ndipolar field lines grows with time. This implies that reconnection must take\nplace in the magnetosphere. We argue that non-dissipative reconnection along\nthe equatorial current sheet allows for the continuous channeling of pulsar\nspindown energy into particle energy, all the way from the light cylinder to\nthe pulsar wind termination shock, and we propose that this effect may account\nfor the low \\sigma values inferred by observations.

The technique used to\nconstruct CQ is easily extended to produce larger sequence families and an\nexample is provided.\n  Selected family SQ has a lower value of theta_max but permits only (m+1)-bit\ndata modulation.

We emphasize that all of these\nvector-like particles can be obtained in the interesting flipped SU(5) x U(1)_X\nstring models from the four-dimensional free fermionic string construction.\nAssuming the low-energy supersymmetry, high-scale supersymmetry, and split\nsupersymmetry, we show that the string-scale gauge coupling unification can\nindeed be achieved in the flipped SU(5) x U(1)_X models. These models can be\ntested at the LHC by observing simple sets of vector-like particles at the TeV\nscale. Moreover, we discuss a simple flipped SU(5) x U(1)_X model with\nstring-scale gauge coupling unification and high-scale supersymmetry by\nintroducing only one pair of the vector-like particles at the TeV scale, and we\npredict the corresponding Higgs boson masses. Also, we briefly comment on the\nstring-scale gauge coupling unification in the model with low-energy\nsupersymmetry by introducing only one pair of the vector-like particles at the\nintermediate scale. And we briefly comment on the mixings among the SM fermions\nand the corresponding extra vector-like particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2006 16:28:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Mar 2007 17:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Our objective is to design\nan alarm time which is adapted to the history of the arrival process and\ndetects the disorder time as soon as possible. In previous solvable versions of\nthe Poisson disorder problem, the arrival rate after the disorder has been\nassumed a known constant. In reality, however, we may at most have some prior\ninformation about the likely values of the new arrival rate before the disorder\nactually happens, and insufficient estimates of the new rate after the disorder\nhappens. Consequently, we assume in this paper that the new arrival rate after\nthe disorder is a random variable. The detection problem is shown to admit a\nfinite-dimensional Markovian sufficient statistic, if the new rate has a\ndiscrete distribution with finitely many atoms. Furthermore, the detection\nproblem is cast as a discounted optimal stopping problem with running cost for\na finite-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov process. This optimal\nstopping problem is studied in detail in the special case where the new arrival\nrate has Bernoulli distribution. This is a nontrivial optimal stopping problem\nfor a two-dimensional piecewise-deterministic Markov process driven by the same\npoint process.

The conventional Raman Langmuir wave is\ntransformed into a set of beam acoustic modes [L. Yin et al., Phys. Rev. E 73,\n025401 (2006)]. For the first time, a low phase velocity electron acoustic wave\n(EAW) is seen developing from the self-consistent Raman physics. Backscatter of\nthe pump laser off the EAW fluctuations is reported and referred to as electron\nacoustic Thomson scatter. This light is similar in wavelength to, although much\nlower in amplitude than, the reflected light between the pump and SRBS\nwavelengths observed in single hot spot experiments, and previously interpreted\nas stimulated electron acoustic scatter [D. S. Montgomery et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. 87, 155001 (2001)]. The EAW is strongest well below the phase-matched\nfrequency for electron acoustic scatter, and therefore the EAW is not produced\nby it. The beating of different beam acoustic modes is proposed as the EAW\nexcitation mechanism, and is called beam acoustic decay. Supporting evidence\nfor this process, including bispectral analysis, is presented. The linear\nelectrostatic modes, found by projecting the numerical distribution function\nonto a Gauss-Hermite basis, include beam acoustic modes (some of which are\nunstable even without parametric coupling to light waves) and a strongly-damped\nEAW similar to the observed one.

We show that the subsystem compatibility problem can be solved\nnumerically and efficiently using semidefinite programming, and that the\nnumerical results from this solution can be used to extract exact analytic\nresults, an idea which we use to disprove a conjecture about the subsystem\nproblem made by Butterley et al. [Found. Phys. 36 83 (2006)]. Finally, we\nconsider how the ideas can be used to tackle some important variants of the\ncompatibility problem; in particular, the case of identical particles (known as\nN-representability in the case of fermions) is considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2006 10:46:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2007 17:59:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

When an atom is in strong\ncoupling with a cavity mode1,2, it is possible to realize key quantum\ninformation processing (QIP) tasks, such as controlled coherent coupling and\nentanglement of distinguishable quantum systems. Realizing these tasks in the\nsolid state is clearly desirable, and coupling semiconductor self-assembled\nquantum dots (QDs) to monolithic optical cavities is a promising route to this\nend. However, validating the efficacy of QDs in QIP applications requires\nconfirmation of the quantum nature of the QD-cavity system in the strong\ncoupling regime. Here we find a confirmation by observing quantum correlations\nin photoluminescence (PL) from a photonic crystal (PC) nanocavity3-5\ninteracting with one, and only one, QD located precisely at the cavity electric\nfield maximum. When off-resonance, photon emission from the cavity mode and QD\nexcitons is anti-correlated at the level of single quanta, proving that the\nmode is driven solely by the QD despite an energy mis-match between cavity and\nexcitons. When tuned into resonance, the exciton and photon enter the\nstrong-coupling regime of cavity-QED and the QD lifetime reduces by a factor of\n120. The photon stream from the cavity becomes anti-bunched, proving that the\ncoupled exciton/photon system is in the quantum anharmonic regime. Our\nobservations unequivocally show that QIP tasks requiring the quantum nonlinear\nregime are achievable in the solid state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Oct 2006 14:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
