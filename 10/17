Several techniques have been used to probe the mass\ndistributions of clusters, sometimes yielding results which are discrepant, or\nat odds with clusters formed in simulations - for example giving NFW\nconcentration parameters much higher than expected in the standard CDM model.\nIn addition, the velocity fields of some well studied galaxy clusters reveal\nthe presence of several structures close to the line-of-sight, often not\ndynamically bound to the cluster itself. We investigate what impact such\nneighbouring but unbound massive structures would have on the determination of\ncluster profiles using weak gravitational lensing. Depending on its\nconcentration and mass ratio to the primary halo, one secondary halo close to\nthe line-of-sight can cause the estimated NFW concentration parameter to be\nsignificantly higher than that of the primary halo, and also cause the\nestimated mass to be biased high. Although it is difficult to envisage how this\nmechanism alone could yield concentrations as high as reported for some\nclusters, multiple haloes close to the line-of-sight, such as in the case of\nAbell 1689, can substantially increase the concentration parameter estimate.\nTogether with the fact that clusters are triaxial, and that including baryonic\nphysics also leads to an increase in the concentration of a dark matter halo,\nthe tension between observations and the standard CDM model is eased. If the\nalignment with the secondary structure is imprecise, then the estimated\nconcentration parameter can also be even lower than that of the primary halo,\nreinforcing the importance of identifying structures in cluster fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2006 01:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We also calculate the spin stiffness in optimally annealed\nsample as a function of $Mn^{2+}$ concentration. A comparison to available\nmeasurements is done.

An action is proposed in field\ntheory in 4+2 dimensions which correctly reproduces the Standard Model (SM) in\n3+1 dimensions (and no junk). Everything that is known to work in the SM still\nworks in the emergent 3+1 theory, but some of the problems of the SM get\nresolved. The resolution is due to new restrictions on interactions inherited\nfrom 4+2 dimensions that lead to some interesting physics and new points of\nview not discussed before in 3+1 dimensions. In particular the strong CP\nviolation problem is resolved without an axion, and the electro-weak symmetry\nbreakdown that generates masses requires the participation of the dilaton, thus\nrelating the electro-weak phase transition to other phase transitions (such as\nevolution of the universe, vacuum selection in string theory, etc.) that also\nrequire the participation of the dilaton.

Given a\nmatrix $X$ with columns that form an orthonormal basis for a subspace $\\X$, and\na Hermitian matrix $A$, the eigenvalues of $X^HAX$ are called Ritz values of\n$A$ with respect to $\\X$. If the subspace $\\X$ is $A$-invariant then the Ritz\nvalues are some of the eigenvalues of $A$.

This is done using a\ncellular automaton model. This model exhibits a high degree of complexity,\nleading to a rich variety of behaviour. Conventional statistical methods fail\nto adequately capture this richness. Particular attention is paid to the\nproperties of the attrition function.

Fractal methods are found to be capable of\nquantifying these properties. A particularly significant result is the\nnon-linearity of the pay-off of improved weapons performance. This contrasts\nwith conventional models, where the attrition rate usually depends in a linear\nway on kill probability. Additionally, the model is found to possess at least\ntwo attractive states.

A robust\nfunction may have preferences in the topological structures of the underlying\nnetwork. We carried out an exhaustive computational analysis on network\ntopologies in relation to a patterning function in Drosophila embryogenesis. We\nfound that while the vast majority of topologies can either not perform the\nrequired function or only do so very fragilely, a small fraction of topologies\nemerges as particularly robust for the function. The topology adopted by\nDrosophila, that of the segment polarity network, is a top ranking one among\nall topologies with no direct autoregulation. Furthermore, we found that all\nrobust topologies are modular--each being a combination of three kinds of\nmodules. These modules can be traced back to three sub-functions of the\npatterning function and their combinations provide a combinatorial variability\nfor the robust topologies. Our results suggest that the requirement of\nfunctional robustness drastically reduces the choices of viable topology to a\nlimited set of modular combinations among which nature optimizes its choice\nunder evolutionary and other biological constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2006 00:46:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2006 00:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
