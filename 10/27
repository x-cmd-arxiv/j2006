We assume that the location of the\ndissipation region is a function of the bulk Lorentz factor Gamma of the jet,\nbeing closer to the center for smaller Gamma. This assumption is naturally\nfulfilled in the internal shock scenario. The dissipated energy is partially\nused to accelerate electrons and to amplify the magnetic field. This process\ncreates a source inside the jet (blob). Such blobs may efficiently produce\nsynchrotron and inverse Compton emission. We find that even if the blobs or\nshells responsible for the blazar activity carry the same energy (in bulk\nkinetic form), the fact that they move at different Gamma can produce dramatic\nvariations in different bands, even if the bolometric luminosity is instead\nvery similar. This is due to the relative importance of the synchrotron,\nself-Compton and external Compton radiation processes, which greatly changes by\nchanging Gamma and the compactness of the source, even if the total radiated\nenergy is constant. We then find that the jet can produce most of its radiative\noutput at small distances from the putative black-hole and its accretion disk,\nif this implies a low level of emitted MeV-GeV flux.

We have unveiled the known embedded SK 1 source (in the dust shell of\nthe SSV 13 ridge) and detailed structure of the region, among some other young\nprotostars. In agreement with the SK 1 observations, our map of the region\nshows lumpy filaments and shells/cavities that seem to be created by outflows.\nThe measured mass of SK 1 (~0.07 Msun) is much less than its virial mass\n(~0.2-1 Msun). Our observations support the idea of SK 1 as an event triggered\nby outflow-driven shells in NGC 1333 (induced by an increase in gas pressure\nand density due to radiation pressure from the stellar winds, that have\npresumably created the dust shell). This kind of evidences provides a more\nthorough understanding of the star formation regulation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2006 12:23:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\nessential physical concept involved is that simultaneous migration of two\nunlike mobile ions in mixed ionic glass is accompanied by expansion or\ncontraction of the guest-occupied sites with distortion of surrounding glass\nmatrix; in many cases, an intensity of the local stresses in glass matrix\nsurrounding ionic sites occupied by foreign ions is much greater than, or at\nleast comparable to the glass network binding energy. Hence, when the stress\nexceeds the breaking threshold, relaxation occurs almost immediately via the\nrupture of the bonds in the nearest glass matrix with generation of pairs of\nintrinsic structural defects. The specificity of the mechanism of defect\ngeneration leads to the clustering of negatively charged defects, so that\nrearranged sites act as high energy anion traps in glass matrix. This results\nin the immobilization of almost all minority mobile species and part of\nmajority mobile species, so mixed mobile ion glass behaves as single mobile ion\nglass of much lower concentration of charge carriers. Generation of defects\nleads also to the depolymerization of glass network, which in turn results in\nthe reduction of the glass viscosity and Tg as well as in the compaction of\nglass structure (thermometer effect). The magnitude of the mixed mobile ion\neffect is defined by the size mismatch of unlike mobile ions, their total and\nrelative concentrations, the binding energy of the glass-forming network, and\ntemperature. Although the proposed model is based upon the exploration of\nalkali silicate glass-forming system, the approach developed here can be easily\nadopted to other mixed ionic systems such as crystalline and even liquid ionic\nconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2006 17:08:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

For strong\nmomentum scattering or slow spin precession we recover the D'yakonov-Perel\nresult, according to which the spin relaxation time is inversely proportional\nto the momentum relaxation time. On the other hand, we find that, in the\nballistic regime the carrier spin polarization shows a very different\nqualitative behavior.

We re-examine the prospects for observing such black holes\nwith the IceCube neutrino-detection experiment. To this end, we first revise\nthe black hole production rate by incorporating the effects of inelasticty,\ni.e., the energy radiated in gravitational waves by the multipole moments of\nthe incoming shock waves. After that we study in detail the process of Hawking\nevaporation accounting for the black hole's large momentum in the lab system.\nWe derive the energy spectrum of the Planckian cloud which is swept forward\nwith a large, O (10^6), Lorentz factor. (It is noteworthy that the boosted\nthermal spectrum is also relevant for the study of near-extremal supersymmetric\nblack holes, which could be copiously produced at the LHC.) In the\nsemiclassical regime, we estimate the average energy of the boosted particles\nto be less than 20% the energy of the neutrino-progenitor. Armed with such a\nconstraint, we determine the discovery reach of IceCube by tagging on \"soft\"\n(relative to what one would expect from charged current standard model\nprocesses) muons escaping the electromagnetic shower bubble produced by the\nblack hole's light descendants.

The main results of\nthis paper are: (a) if $d \\equiv \\epsilon$ (mod 2) then $S^{1, d -\n1}(\\epsilon)$ has a unique minimal triangulation using $2d + 3$ vertices, and\n(b) if $d \\equiv 1 - \\epsilon$ (mod 2) then $S^{1, d - 1}(\\epsilon)$ has\nminimal triangulations (not unique) using $2d + 4$ vertices. The second result\nconfirms a recent conjecture of Lutz. The first result provides the first known\ninfinite family of closed manifolds (other than spheres) for which the minimal\ntriangulation is unique. Actually, we show that while $S^{1, d - 1}(\\epsilon)$\nhas at most one $(2d + 3)$-vertex triangulation (one if $d \\equiv \\epsilon$\n(mod 2), zero otherwise), in sharp contrast, the number of non-isomorphic $(2d\n+ 4)$-vertex triangulations of these $d$-manifolds grows exponentially with $d$\nfor either choice of $\\epsilon$.

This amazing simplicial\ncomplex was first constructed by K\\\"{u}hnel in 1986. Generalizing a 1987 result\nof Brehm and K\\\"{u}hnel, we prove that (d) any triangulation of a non-simply\nconnected closed $d$-manifold requires at least $2d + 3$ vertices.

The problem remains BQP-hard for\nregular graphs with degree 4.\n  The second problem is related to continuous-time classical random walks. The\nwalk starts at some vertex j. The promise is that the difference of the\nprobabilities of being at j and at i, respectively, decays with O(exp(-\\mu t))\nfor some \\mu>0. The problem is to decide whether this difference is greater\nthan a exp(-\\mu T) or smaller than b exp(-\\mu T) after some time instant T,\nwhere T is polylogarithmic and the difference a-b is inverse polylogarithmic in\nthe number of vertices. Since the probabilities differ only by an exponentially\nsmall amount, an exponential number of trials would be necessary if one tried\nto answer this question by running the walk itself.\n  A modification of this problem, asking whether there exists a pair of nodes\nfor which the probability difference is at least a exp(-\\mu T), is\nQCMA-complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2006 10:44:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Oct 2006 07:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is a useful resource to enhance the mutual information of\nmemory channels or to accelerate some quantum processes as, for example, the\nfactorization in Shor's Algorithm. Moreover, entanglement is a physical\nobservable directly measured by the von Neumann entropy of the system. We have\nused this concept in order to give a physical meaning to the electron\ncorrelation energy in systems of interacting electrons. The electronic\ncorrelation is not directly observable, since it is defined as the difference\nbetween the exact ground state energy of the many--electrons Schroedinger\nequation and the Hartree--Fock energy. We have calculated the correlation\nenergy and compared with the entanglement, as functions of the nucleus--nucleus\nseparation using, for the hydrogen molecule, the Configuration Interaction\nmethod. Then, in the same spirit, we have analyzed a dimer of ethylene, which\nrepresents the simplest organic conjugate system, changing the relative\norientation and distance of the molecules, in order to obtain the configuration\ncorresponding to maximum entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2006 15:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
