The presence of CS polarisation signatures formed in the stellar\nwind supports the assumption that the magnetic centrifuge is a principal\nmechanism of wind acceleration.

We compare the Kurganov-Tadmor, 2000 semi-discrete\ncentral scheme with the Nessyahu-Tadmor, 1990 central scheme. The KT scheme\nuses more precise information about the local speeds of propagation together\nwith integration over nonuniform control volumes, which contain the Riemann\nfans. These methods can accurately resolve sharp fronts in the fluid\nsaturations without introducing spurious oscillations or excessive numerical\ndiffusion. We first discuss the coupling of these methods with velocity fields\napproximated by mixed finite elements. Then, numerical simulations are\npresented for two-phase, two-dimensional flow problems in multi-scale\nheterogeneous petroleum reservoirs. We find the KT scheme to be considerably\nless diffusive, particularly in the presence of high permeability flow\nchannels, which lead to strong restrictions on the time step selection;\nhowever, the KT scheme may produce incorrect boundary behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2006 14:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2006 13:39:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 Mar 2008 22:50:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 4 Jan 2009 22:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-05"}
