In this work\nwe study the effects that opacity and noise have on the determination of Df. We\nfocus on two different fractal dimension estimators: the perimeter-area based\ndimension (Dper) and the mass-size dimension (Dm). We first use simulated\nfractal clouds to show that opacity does not affect the estimation of Dper.\nHowever, Dm tends to increase as opacity increases and this estimator fails\nwhen applied to optically thick regions. In addition, very noisy maps can\nseriously affect the estimation of both Dper and Dm, decreasing the final\nestimation of Df. We apply these methods to emission maps of Ophiuchus, Perseus\nand Orion molecular clouds in different molecular lines and we obtain that the\nfractal dimension is always in the range 2.6 < Df < 2.8 for these regions.\nThese results support the idea of a relatively high (> 2.3) average fractal\ndimension for the interstellar medium, as traced by different chemical species.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2006 07:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

A compilation of planets in\nbinary systems was made; a search for companions orbiting stars recently shown\nto host planets was performed, resulting in the addition of two further binary\nplanet hosts (HD 20782 and HD 109749). The probable original properties of the\nthree binary planet hosts with white dwarfs companions were also investigated.\nUsing this updated sample of planets in binaries we performed a statistical\nanalysis of the distributions of planet mass, period, and eccentricity,\nfraction of multiplanet systems, and stellar metallicity for planets orbiting\ncomponents of tight and wide binaries and single stars. The only highly\nsignificant difference revealed by our analysis concerns the mass distribution\nof short-period planets.

Recently, we have shown that an equilibrated self-organized\ntwo-dimensional lattice-based model also possesses an intermediate phase in\nwhich a percolating rigid cluster exists with a probability between zero and\none, depending on the average coordination of the network. In this paper, we\nstudy the properties of this intermediate phase in more detail. We find that\nmicroscopic perturbations, such as the addition or removal of a single bond,\ncan affect the rigidity of macroscopic regions of the network, in particular,\ncreating or destroying percolation. This, together with a power-law\ndistribution of rigid cluster sizes, suggests that the system is maintained in\na critical state on the rigid/floppy boundary throughout the intermediate\nphase, a behavior similar to self-organized criticality, but, remarkably, in a\nthermodynamically equilibrated state. The distinction between percolating and\nnon-percolating networks appears physically meaningless, even though the\npercolating cluster, when it exists, takes up a finite fraction of the network.\nWe point out both similarities and differences between the intermediate phase\nand the critical point of ordinary percolation models without\nself-organization.

The URL of the school is http://esslli2006.lcc.uma.es/ . This version\nslightly differs from the one which has been distributed at the school because\ntypos have been removed and comments and suggestions by students have been\nworked in. The course is intended to be introductory. That means no prior\nknowledge of proof nets is required. However, the student should be familiar\nwith the basics of propositional logic, and should have seen formal proofs in\nsome formal deductive system (e.g., sequent calculus, natural deduction,\nresolution, tableaux, calculus of structures, Frege-Hilbert-systems, ...). It\nis probably helpful if the student knows already what cut elimination is, but\nthis is not strictly necessary. In these notes, I will introduce the concept of\n``proof nets'' from the viewpoint of the problem of the identity of proofs. I\nwill proceed in a rather informal way. The focus will be more on presenting\nideas than on presenting technical details. The goal of the course is to give\nthe student an overview of the theory of proof nets and make the vast amount of\nliterature on the topic easier accessible to the beginner. For introducing the\nbasic concepts of the theory, I will in the first part of the course stick to\nthe unit-free multiplicative fragment of linear logic because of its rather\nsimple notion of proof nets. In the second part of the course we will see proof\nnets for more sophisticated logics. This is a basic introduction into proof\nnets from the perspective of the identity of proofs. We discuss how deductive\nproofs can be translated into proof nets and what a correctness criterion is.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2006 11:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Nov 2006 14:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This has important applications to multiple assets price modeling for\nforecasting, option pricing, risk and credit risk management. An approach\ncommonly used to estimate IC is to take the sum of the cross products of the\ntwo processes increments; however this estimator can be highly biased in the\npresence of jumps, since it approaches the quadratic ovariation, which contains\nalso the co-jumps. Our estimator of IC is based on a threshold (or truncation)\ntechnique. We prove that the estimator is consistent in both cases as the\nnumber of observations increases to infinity. Further, in presence of only\nfinite activity jumps 1) \\hat{IC} is also asymptotically Gaussian; 2) a joint\nCLT for \\hat{IC} and threshold estimators of the integrated variances of the\nsingle processes allows to reach consistent and asymptotically Gaussian\nestimators even of the $\\beta$s and of the correlation coefficient among the\ndiffusion parts of the two processes, allowing a better measurement of their\ndependence; 3) thresholding gives an estimate of IC which is robust to the\nasynchronicity of the observations. We conduct a simulation study to check that\nthe application of our technique is in fact informative for values of the step\nbetween the observations large enough to avoid the typical problems arising in\npresence of microstructure noises in the data, and to asses the choice of the\nthreshold parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2006 11:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 13:15:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-10"}

A similar phenomenon was found in a dual-core system\nwith quadratic nonlinearity, and in linearly coupled fiber Bragg gratings, with\na difference that the symmetry-breaking bifurcation is supercritical in those\ncases. We aim to study transitions between symmetric and asymmetric solitons in\ndual-core systems with saturable nonlinearity. We demonstrate that a basic\nmodel of this type, viz., a pair of linearly coupled NLS equations with the\nintra-core cubic-quintic (CQ) nonlinearity, features a bifurcation loop: a\nsymmetric soliton loses its stability via a supercritical bifurcation, which is\nfollowed, at a larger value of the energy, by a reverse bifurcation that\nrestores the stability of the symmetric soliton. If the linear-coupling\nconstant is small enough, the second bifurcation is subcritical, and there is a\nbroad interval of energies in which the system is bistable, with coexisting\nstable symmetric and asymmetric solitons. At larger values of the coupling\nconstant, the reverse bifurcation is supercritical, and the bifurcation loop\ndisappears if the linear coupling is very strong. Collisions between moving\nsolitons are studied too. Symmetric solitons always collide elastically, while\ncollisions between asymmetric solitons turns them into breathers, that\nsubsequently undergo dynamical symmetrization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2006 15:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
