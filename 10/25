This novel\nsynchronization mechanism relies on a nonlinear wave interaction spinning down\nthe background star. The essential physics of the synchronization mechanism is\nsummarized as follows. As the compact binary coalesces due to gravitational\nwave emission, the largest star eventually fills its Roche lobe and accretion\nstarts. The accretor then spins up due to infalling material and eventually\nreaches a spin frequency where a normal mode of the star is resonantly driven\nby the gravitational tidal field of the companion. If the resonating mode\nsatisfies a set of specific criteria, which we elucidate in this paper, it\nexchanges angular momentum with the background star at a rate such that the\nspin of the accretor locks at this resonant frequency, even though accretion is\nongoing. Some of the accreted angular momentum that would otherwise spin up the\naccretor is fed back into the orbit through this resonant tidal interaction.\n  Two modes capable of stabilizing the accretor's spin are the l=4,m=2 and\nl=5,m=3 CFS unstable hybrid r-modes, which stabilize the spin of the accretor\nat frequency 2.6 and 1.5 times the binary's orbital frequency respectively.\nSince the stabilization mechanism relies on continuously driving a mode at\nresonance, its lifetime is limited since eventually the mode amplitude\nsaturates due to non-linear mode-mode coupling. Rough estimates of the lifetime\nof the effect lie from a few orbits to millions of years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2006 19:54:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Sep 2007 19:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We study the\npossibility that the observed 6-Li was produced by repeated solar-like flares\non the main sequence of these low-metallicity stars. The time-dependent flaring\nactivity of these objects is estimated from the observed evolution of\nrotation-induced activity in Pop I dwarf stars. As in solar flares, 6-Li could\nbe mainly created in interactions of flare-accelerated 3-He with stellar\natmospheric 4-He, via the reaction 4-He(3-He,p)6-Li.

We show that at finite density a\nrecently discovered phase of cold baryonic matter emerges as a baryon crystal\nfrom a spatially inhomogeneous fermion condensate. However, we also demonstrate\nthat on the lattice, this new phase disappears at large coupling or in small\nvolumes. Furthermore, we investigate unusual finite size effects that appear at\nfinite chemical potential. Finally, we speculate on the implications of our\nfindings for QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2006 08:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

There is also no criterion of\na choice either damping or growing solution in difference from always\nnon-damping in the direction of propagation Vlasov waves. Variety of other\nincongruities as consequence of Landau damping is specified also. Absence of\nexplicit positivity and finiteness of wave solutions for electron distribution\nfunction near singularity point leads to need of imposing additional cutting\noff constraints with resulting positivity and finiteness of the electron\ndistribution function at the singularity points and finiteness of the complex\ndispersion integral. Landau damping as a real physical phenomenon of\ncollisionless damping does not exist. A relation is established for the real\ndispersion equation with real waves (see Appendices 2,4) between the averaged\nover period wave damping decrement and the collisional energy-exchange term of\nkinetic equation. Collisionless Vlasov-Landau damping is explained finally by\nthe usual wrong use of nonlinearly complex wave functions leading to complex\ndispersion equation. All used solution of the complex dispersion equation for\nthe simultaneously existing collisionless both exponentially damping and\ngrowing nonlinear complex waves is entirely, quantitatively and in its logical\nsense, different from the solution of initially real dispersion equation for\nreal either damping or growing waves and should be discarded (see Appendices\n2,4,5,6). Collisionless damping is caused by unreasonable use of wave functions\nwith complex frequency or complex wave number leading to complex dispersion\nrelation with unphysical binomial virtual complex roots.

We measure the efficiency of such a quantum\nchannel {\\em via} the fidelity of retrieving an arbitrarily prepared state and\n{\\em via} the transfer of quantum entanglement. The Heisenberg spin-1 chain has\na very rich quantum phase diagram. We show that the phase boundaries are\nreflected in sharp variations of the transfer efficiency. In the vicinity of\nthe border between the dimer and the ferromagnetic phase (in the conjectured\nspin-nematic region), we find strong indications for a qualitative change of\nthe excitation spectrum. Moreover, we identify two regions of the phase diagram\nwhich give rise to particularly high transfer efficiency; the channel might be\nnon-classical even for chains of arbitrary length, in contrast to spin-1/2\nchains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2006 18:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2006 15:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 May 2007 08:26:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Some of these results\ncarry over to graphs which obey open boundary conditions (OBCs), such as\ncylinders or rectangles. Under OBCs the long time transition probabilities\n(LPs) also display asymmetries for certain graphs, as a function of their\nparticular sizes.
