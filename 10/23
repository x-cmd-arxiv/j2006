For L=1 orbitally excited states, two\nof the unknown couplings, namely, $h_2$ and $h_{10}$, are determined from the\nresonant $\\Lambda_c^+\\pi\\pi$ mode produced in the $\\Lambda_c(2593)$ decay and\nthe width of $\\Sigma_c(2800)$, respectively.

Exact relations are obtained for\ncalculating these contributions for arbitrary propagation distances, along with\napproximate expressions for the near field. The behavior of the two\ncontributions is illustrated for the case of a plane wave diffracted by a slit\nin an opaque screen. The finite-difference time-domain (FD-TD) method is used\nexamine the influence of exact boundary values on the near field for the case\nof a slit in a thin perfectly conducting screen. The FD-TD numerical results\nare displayed in color images that illustrate the intricate behavior of the\namplitude and the phase of the field in the vicinity of the slit. These\nnumerical results are compared with the predictions of approximate theories.\nSome new methods for determining near-fields in rigorous diffraction problems\ninvolving thin screens are discussed.

In order to understand the effects of an optical vortex on\ndiffraction, the field emerging from a spiral phase plate illuminated by a\nGaussian beam is examined.

Due to the\nanisotropy they exhibit a two-channel structure. We first establish the\nexistence and properties of the channel wave and scattering operators by using\nthe modern Mourre approach. We then use scattering theory to show the identity\nof two apparently different representations of time delay. The first one is\ndefined in terms of sojourn times while the second one is given by the\nEisenbud-Wigner operator. The identity of these representations is well known\nfor systems where $V(x)$ vanishes as $|x| \\to \\infty$ ($V_\\ell = V_r$). We show\nthat it remains true in the anisotropic case $V_\\ell \\not = V_r$, i.e. we prove\nthe existence of the time-dependent representation of time delay and its\nequality with the time-independent Eisenbud-Wigner representation. Finally we\nuse this identity to give a time-dependent interpretation of the\nEisenbud-Wigner expression which is commonly used for time delay in the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2006 14:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-05"}

Efficient quantum list decoders have been used to\nprove a quantum hardcore property of classical codes. However, the code rates\nof all known families of efficiently quantum list-decodable codes are,\nunfortunately, too small for other practical applications. To improve those\nknown code rates, we prove that a specific code family of polynomially small\ncode rate over a fixed code alphabet, obtained by concatenating generalized\nReed-Solomon codes as outer codes with Hadamard codes as inner codes, has an\nefficient quantum list-decoding algorithm if its codewords have relatively high\ncodeword presence in a given quantumly corrupted codeword. As an immediate\napplication, we use the quantum list decodability of this code family to solve\na certain form of quantum search problems in polynomial time. When the codeword\npresence becomes smaller, in contrast, we show that the quantum list\ndecodability of generalized Reed-Solomon codes with high confidence is closely\nrelated to the efficient solvability of the following two problems: the noisy\npolynomial interpolation problem and the bounded distance vector problem.\nMoreover, assuming that NP is not included in BQP, we also prove that no\nefficient quantum list decoder exists for the generalized Reed-Solomon codes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2006 14:57:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2006 10:18:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Sep 2011 02:52:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 19:50:03 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 14 Oct 2016 16:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-09-15"}
