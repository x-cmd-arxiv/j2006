This calculation thus applies to all models\nof assisted inflation, including N-flation, where inflation is driven by\nmultiple axion fields arising from shift symmetries in a flux stabilized string\nvacuum. The non-Gaussianities are associated with nonlinear evolution of the\nfield (and density) perturbations, characterized by the parameter $f_{NL}$. We\nderive a general expression for the nonlinear parameter, incorporating the\nevolution of perturbations after horizon-crossing. This is valid for arbitrary\nseparable potentials during slow roll. To develop an intuitive understanding of\nthis system and to demonstrate the applicability of the formalism we examine\nseveral cases with quadratic potentials: two-field models with a wide range of\nmass ratios, and a general N-field model with a narrow mass spectrum. We\nuncover that $f_{NL}$ is suppressed as the number of e-foldings grows, and that\nthis suppression is increased in models with a broad spectrum of masses. On the\nother hand, we find no enhancement to $f_{NL}$ that increases with the number\nof fields. We thus conclude that the production of a large non-Gaussian signal\nin multi-field models of inflation is very unlikely as long as fields are\nslowly rolling and potentials are of simple, quadratic form. Finally, we\ncompute a spectrum for the scalar spectral index that incorporates the\nnonlinear corrections to the fields' evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2006 17:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 2007 17:40:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Mar 2007 12:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

In order to determine the physical\nconditions that pertain to molecular gas close to the sources of radiation,\nnumerical models are constructed. These models determine the thermal and\nchemical balance of molecular gas that is exposed to X-rays and far-ultraviolet\nradiation, as a function of depth. We present a grid of XDR and PDR models that\nspan ranges in density, irradiation and column density. We find that the\nfine-structure line ratios of e.g. [SiII] 35mum/[CII] 158 mum are larger in\nXDRs than in PDRs, for a given density, column and irradiation strength. We\nfind that the line ratios HCN/HCO+ and HNC/HCN, as well as the column density\nratio CN/HCN, discriminate between PDRs and XDRs. The HCN/HCO+ 1-0 ratio is <1\n(>1) for XDRs (PDRs) if the density exceeds 10^5 cm^-3 and if the column\ndensity is >10^23 cm^-2. For columns <10^ 22.5 cm^-2 the XDR HCN/HCO+ 1-0 ratio\nbecomes larger than one, although the individual HCN 1-0 and HCO+ 1-0 line\nintensities are weaker. For modest densities, n=10^4-10^5 cm^-3, and strong\nradiation fields (>100 erg s^-1 cm^-2), HCN/HCO+ ratios can become larger in\nXDRs than PDRs as well. The HCN/CO 1-0 ratio is typically smaller in XDRs, and\nthe HCN emission in XDRs is boosted with respect to CO only for columns\n>10^{23} cm^{-2} and densities <10^4 cm^-3.

Utilizing a new method based on the effects of a\nfield on the FeH band near 1 micron, we obtain information on whether the\nintegrated surface magnetic flux (Bf) is low (well under 1 kilogauss),\nintermediate (between 1 and about 2.5 kG), or strong (greater than about 3 kG)\non a set of stars ranging from M2 down to M9.

Our goal is to\nadvance the understanding of how dynamo field production varies with stellar\nparameters for very low-mass stars, how the field and emission activity are\nrelated, and whether there is a connection between the rotation and magnetic\nflux. We find that fields are produced throughout the M-dwarfs. Among the early\nM stars we have too few targets to yield conclusive results. In the mid-M\nstars, there is a clear connection between slow rotation and weak fields. In\nthe late-M stars, rotation is always measureable, and the strongest fields go\nwith the most rapid rotators. These very cool rapid rotators have the largest\nmagnetic flux in the whole sample. Halpha emission is found to be a good\ngeneral proxy for magnetic fields. The drop-off in fractional emission near the\nbottom of the main sequence is not accompanied by a drop-off in magnetic flux,\nlending credence to the hypothesis that it is due to atmospheric coupling to\nthe field rather than changes in the field itself.

The results are compared to those\ninferred from standard line profile analyses. This new method enables us to\nderive redshift scales characterizing the fluctuations of the column density\nratio eta. We find eta changing smoothly with redshift on typical scales of\nDelta z ~ 0.01-0.03 corresponding to 8-24 h^-1 Mpc comoving. The real length\nscales of variations of the column density ratio might be even larger, since\npart of the fluctuations may be caused by noise in the HeII data and by effects\ndue to the applied method. However, eta variations on small scales of a few Mpc\nwith an amplitude of about +/- 1.5 dex cannot be ruled out completely. The data\nshows an apparent correlation between low eta regions and the presence of metal\nline absorbers, which corresponds to the more general correlation of low eta\nand strong HI absorption. Thermal line broadening is suggested as a probable\nexplanation for this apparent correlation, since both fit methods would\nseverely underestimate eta for absorbers with log N(HI) > 13 if the line width\nwas dominated by thermal broadening. Indeed, lines located close to the cut-off\nof the b(N) distribution yield lower column density ratios compared to the\nwhole sample, in particular if high density absorbers are considered.

In the near-static\nJosephson vortex state for a low tunneling bias current, pronounced\nmagnetoresistance oscillations were observed, which represented a\ntriangular-lattice vortex configuration along the c axis. In the dynamic vortex\nstate in a sufficiently high magnetic field and for a high bias current,\nsplitting of a single Josephson vortex-flow branch into multiple sub-branches\nwas observed. Detailed examination of the sub-branches for varying $H$ field\nreveals that sub-branches represent the different modes of the Josephson-vortex\nlattice along the c axis, with varied configuration from a triangular to a\nrectangular lattices. These multiple sub-branches merge to a single curve at a\ncharacteristic temperature, above which no dynamical structural transitions of\nthe Josephson vortex lattice is expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2006 11:55:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The Q**2 evolution of the\nextracted moments is analyzed in terms of an OPE based twist expansion, taking\ninto account soft-gluon effects at large x. A clean separation among the\nLeading and Higher-Twist terms is achieved. By combining proton and deuteron\nmeasurements the lowest moments of the neutron F2 structure function are\ndetermined and its leading twist term is extracted. Particular attention is\npaid to nuclear effects in the deuteron, which become increasingly important\nfor the higher moments. Our results for the non-singlet, isovector (p - n)\ncombination of the leading twist moments are used to test recent lattice\nsimulations. We also determine the lowest few moments of the higher twist\ncontributions, and find these to be approximately isospin independent,\nsuggesting the possible dominance of ud correlations over uu and dd in the\nnucleon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2006 13:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Plant cell walls possess specific difficulties. Several\nreported procedures to isolate cell walls for proteomic analyses led to the\nisolation of a high proportion (more than 50%) of predicted intracellular\nproteins. The rationales of several published procedures to isolate cell walls\nfor proteomics were analyzed, with regard to the bioinformatic-predicted\nsubcellular localization of the identified proteins. A new procedure was\ndeveloped to prepare cell walls from etiolated hypocotyls of Arabidopsis\nthaliana. After salt extraction, a high proportion of proteins predicted to be\nsecreted was released (73%), belonging to the same functional classes as\nproteins identified using previously described protocols. The new cell wall\npreparation described in this paper gives the lowest proportion of proteins\npredicted to be intracellular when compared to available protocols. The\napplication of its principles should lead to a more realistic view of the cell\nwall proteome, at least for the weakly bound CWP extractable by salts. In\naddition, it offers a clean cell wall preparation for subsequent extraction of\nstrongly bound CWP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2006 08:22:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2006 14:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
