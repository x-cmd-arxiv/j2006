However, unlike a\ntraditional coronagraph design, we insert a reflective focal plane mask at 45\ndegree to the optical axis. We also used an intermediate secondary mask\n(\"Mask_2\") before a final image in order to block additional mask-edge\ndiffracted light. The test bench simulates the 8.1m Gemini North telescope. It\nincludes one spider vane, different mask radii (r= 1.9, 3.7, 7.4 lambda/D) and\ntwo types of reflective focal plane masks (hard-edged \"Top Hat\" and \"Gaussian\"\ntapered profiles). In order to investigate the relative performance of these\ncompeting coronagraphic designs with regard to extra-solar planet detection\nsensitivity, we utilize the simulation of realistic extra-solar planet\npopulations (Nielson et al. 2006). With an appropriate translation of our\nlaboratory results to expected telescope performance, a \"Gaussian\" tapered mask\nradius of 3.7 lambda/D with an additional mask (\"Mask_2\") performs best\n(highest planet detection sensitivity). For a full survey with this optimal\ndesign, the simulation predicts ~30% more planets detected compared to a\nsimilar sized \"Top Hat\" function mask with \"Mask_2.\" Using the best design, the\npoint contrast ratio between the stellar PSF peak and the coronagraphic PSF at\n10 lambda/D (0.4\" in H band if D = 8.1m) is ~10 times higher than a classical\nLyot \"Top Hat\" coronagraph. Hence, we find a Gaussian apodized mask with an\nadditional blocking mask is a superior (~10x higher contrast) than use of a\nclassical Lyot coronagraph for ExAO-like Strehls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2006 17:39:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Oct 2006 19:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

It is not known when and where\ngrain growth occurs, as models that explain the observations are often\ndegenerate. A way to break this degeneracy is to resolve the sources under\nstudy. AIMS - To find evidence for the existence of grains of millimetre sizes\nin disks around in T Tauri stars, implying grain growth. METHODS - The\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) was used to observe 15 southern T\nTauri stars, five in the constellation Lupus and ten in Chamaeleon, at 3.3\nmillimetre. The five Lupus sources were also observed with the Submillimeter\nArray (SMA) at 1.4 millimetre. Our new data are complemented with data from the\nliterature to determine the slopes of the spectral energy distributions in the\nmillimetre regime. RESULTS - Ten sources were detected at better than 3sigma\nwith the ATCA, with sigma ~1-2 mJy, and all sources that were observed with the\nSMA were detected at better than 15sigma, with sigma ~4 mJy. Six of the sources\nin our sample are resolved to physical radii of ~100 AU. Assuming that the\nemission from such large disks is predominantly optically thin, the millimetre\nslope can be related directly to the opacity index. For the other sources, the\nopacity indices are lower limits. Four out of six resolved sources have opacity\nindices <~1, indicating grain growth to millimetre sizes and larger. The masses\nof the disks range from < 0.01 to 0.08 MSun, which is comparable to the minimum\nmass solar nebula. A tentative correlation is found between the millimetre\nslope and the strength and shape of the 10-micron silicate feature, indicating\nthat grain growth occurs on similar (short) timescales in both the inner and\nouter disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2006 15:56:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The hydrodynamic equations exhibit a new type\nof finite-time density blowup, where the gas pressure remains finite. The\ndensity blowups signal formation of close-packed clusters. The blowup dynamics\nare universal and describable by exact analytic solutions continuable beyond\nthe blowup time. These solutions show that dilute hydrodynamic equations yield\na powerful effective description of a granular gas flow with close-packed\nclusters, described as finite-mass point-like singularities of the density.\nThis description is similar in spirit to the description of shocks in ordinary\nideal gas dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2006 15:50:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 2007 10:52:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 5 May 2007 13:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

These binding sites have a conserved nucleotide appearance,\nwhich is called a motif. Several recent studies of transcriptional regulation\nrequire the reduction of a large collection of motifs into clusters based on\nthe similarity of their nucleotide composition. We present a principled\napproach to this clustering problem based upon a Bayesian hierarchical model\nthat accounts for both within- and between-motif variability. We use a\nDirichlet process prior distribution that allows the number of clusters to vary\nand we also present a novel generalization that allows the core width of each\nmotif to vary. This clustering model is implemented, using a Gibbs sampling\nstrategy, on several collections of transcription factor motif matrices. Our\nclusters provide a means by which to organize transcription factors based on\nbinding motif similarities, which can be used to reduce motif redundancy within\nlarge databases such as JASPAR and TRANSFAC. Finally, our clustering procedure\nhas been used in combination with discovery of evolutionarily-conserved motifs\nto predict co-regulated genes. An alternative to our Dirichlet process prior\ndistribution is explored but shows no substantive difference in the clustering\nresults for our datasets. Our Bayesian clustering model based on the Dirichlet\nprocess has several advantages over traditional clustering methods that could\nmake our procedure appropriate and useful for many clustering applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Oct 2006 03:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}
