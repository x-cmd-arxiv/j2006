It will be variable when the\nradial co-moving differential coordinate of FLRW is interpreted as physical and\ntherefor transformable by a Lorentz transform locally to differentials of\nstationary physical coordinates. Because the FLRW differential radial distance\nhas a time varying coefficient a(t), in the limit of a zero radial distance the\nlight speed c(t) becomes time varying, proportional to the square root of the\nderivative of a(t) Since we assume homogeneity of space, this derived c(t) is\nthe physical light speed for all events in the FLRW universe. This impacts the\ninterpretation of astronomical observations of distant phenomena that are\nsensitive to light speed. A transform from FLRW is shown to have a physical\nradius out to all radial events in the visible universe. This shows a finite\nhorizon beyond which there are no galaxies and no space. The general relativity\n(GR) field equation to determine a(t) and c(t) is maintained by using a\nvariable gravitational constant and rest mass that keeps constant the\ngravitational and particle rest energies. This keeps constant the\nproportionality constant between the GR tensors of the field equation and\nconserves the stress-energy tensor of the ideal fluid used in the FLRW GR field\nequation. In the same way all of special and general relativity can be extended\nto include a variable light speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2006 17:29:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Oct 2011 19:03:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2013 18:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-23"}

When a\nless polar macromolecule is immersed in a polar environment, the surface free\nenergy minimization occurs naturally to stabilizes the system, and leads to an\nMMS separating the macromolecule from the solvent. For a given set of atomic\nconstraints (as obstacles), the MMS is defined as one whose mean curvature\nvanishes away from the obstacles. An iterative procedure is proposed to compute\nthe MMS. Extensive examples are given to validate the proposed algorithm and\nillustrate the new concept. We show that the MMS provides an indication to\nDNA-binding specificity. The proposed algorithm represents a major step forward\nin minimal surface generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Oct 2006 19:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Here, we distinguish between two modes of\ninference in this setting: direct inference based upon similarities between\nnodes joined by an edge, and indirect inference based upon similarities between\none pair of nodes and another pair of nodes. We propose a supervised approach\nfor the direct case by translating it into a distance metric learning problem.\nA relaxation of the resulting convex optimization problem leads to the support\nvector machine (SVM) algorithm with a particular kernel for pairs, which we\ncall the metric learning pairwise kernel (MLPK). We demonstrate, using several\nreal biological networks, that this direct approach often improves upon the\nstate-of-the-art SVM for indirect inference with the tensor product pairwise\nkernel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Oct 2006 06:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
