The modulation occurs due to\nfree-free absorption in the wind from the companion star varying with the\norbital phase, and our results put strong constraints on the spatial\ndistribution of the jet radio emission at the frequencies of 2-15 GHz. A\ncrucial role in enhancing the asymmetry of the wind absorption suffered by the\njet emission is played by the irradiation by X-rays emitted in the vicinity of\nthe black hole. This increases the wind temperature by more than order of\nmagnitude with respect to that of the wind of an isolated supergiant. The\nobserved phase lags of the minima of the radio emission with respect to the\nspectroscopic zero phase strongly imply the bulk of the mass of the jet is\nnonrelativistic (~5 x 10^8 cm/s) within the jet core. The jet can, however,\nbecome relativistic outside the core. Also, the jet can have a two-component\nstructure, being slow on the outside and fast inside, in which case its\nsynchrotron-emitting part may be relativistic already in the core. We also\nconsider the observed superorbital modulation of the radio emission (with the\nperiod of ~150 d) and find it can be explained by a jet precession both causing\nvariable wind absorption and changing the jet Doppler factor.

We give a picture on \"creation\" of\nthe Universe. By analogy with the original Brans-Dicke relation, several other\nsimilar relations were obtained in a previous paper (Berman, 2007d), which we\nnow extend, by relating the angular momentum L, absolute temperature T, and the\ncosmological \"constant\", with R, where R, M stand for the radius (scale-factor)\nand the mass of the causally related Universe. We show here that these\nproperties, which characterize Machian Universes, can be put in the form of\nequalities, which can be derived, from the conjecture that the total energy of\nthe Universe is null, alike with the effective energy density, and we therefore\nimply that R depends linearly with M ; the angular momentum runs like squared R\n; T, like R to the power -1/2 ; lambda, as R to the power -2 so that the total\nentropy of the Universe grows with R to the power 3/2, and, then, also as M to\nthe power 3/2. The \"loss of information paradox\", for black holes, is\ndismantled. It must be obvious, from this paper, that each type of energy\ncontribution, to the total energy of the Universe, divided by M multiplied by\nc-squared, yields a constant, during all times, so that, for instance, if the\npresent contribution of the cosmological \"constant\", drives the present\nUniverse, it also must have driven alike, in all the lifespan of the Machian\nUniverse: the relative contributions of densities of each kind, towards the\ntotal density, remain the same during all times.

Here we build a mathematical\nmodel aiming to explore this hypothesis. In the model, genes control brains\nwhich invent and learn strategies (memes) which are used by males to gain\nadvantage in competition for mates. We show that the dynamics of intelligence\nhas three distinct phases. During the dormant phase only newly invented memes\nare present in the population. During the cognitive explosion phase the\npopulation's meme count and the learning ability, cerebral capacity\n(controlling the number of different memes that the brain can learn and use),\nand Machiavellian fitness of individuals increase in a runaway fashion. During\nthe saturation phase natural selection resulting from the costs of having large\nbrains checks further increases in cognitive abilities. Overall, our results\nsuggest that the mechanisms underlying the \"Machiavellian intelligence\"\nhypothesis can indeed result in the evolution of significant cognitive\nabilities on the time scale of 10 to 20 thousand generations. We show that\ncerebral capacity evolves faster and to a larger degree than learning ability.\nOur model suggests that there may be a tendency toward a reduction in cognitive\nabilities (driven by the costs of having a large brain) as the reproductive\nadvantage of having a large brain decreases and the exposure to memes increases\nin modern societies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2006 12:11:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2006 12:27:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2006 23:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
