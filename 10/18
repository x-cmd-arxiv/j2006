This motivates models of radiatively\ninefficient accretion, due to either ion-electron thermal decoupling,\ngeneration of outflows that inhibit accretion, or settling of gas to a\ngravitationally unstable disk that forms stars in preference to feeding the\nblack hole. The latter model predicts the presence of cold molecular gas in a\nthin disk around the black hole. Here we report Submillimeter Array\nobservations of the nucleus of the giant elliptical galaxy M87 that probe 230\nGHz continuum and CO(J=2--1) line emission. Continuum emission is detected from\nthe nucleus and several knots in the jet, including one that has been\nundergoing flaring behavior. We estimate a conservative upper limit on the mass\nof molecular gas within ~100pc and +-400km/s line of sight velocity of the\ncentral black hole of ~8x10^6Msun, which includes an allowance for possible\nsystematic errors associated with subtraction of the continuum. Ignoring such\nerrors, we have a 3 sigma sensitivity to about 3x10^6Msun. In fact, the\ncontinuum-subtracted spectrum shows weak emission features extending up to 4\nsigma above the RMS dispersion of the line-free channels. These may be\nartifacts of the continuum subtraction process. Alternatively, if they are\ninterpreted as CO emission, then the implied molecular gas mass is ~5x10^6Msun\nspread out over a velocity range of 700km/s. These constraints on molecular gas\nmass are close to the predictions of the model of self-gravitating,\nstar-forming accretion disks fed by Bondi accretion (Tan & Blackman 2005).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2006 19:56:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jul 2007 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Jul 2008 19:15:32 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 14:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Tuning the model to match the observed shell thickness\nallows us to determine the threshold density which permits survival of H2. An\naverage hydrogen density of n_H=(0.5-1)x10^7 cm-3 in the outer zone is required\nto allow H2 to exist at all latitudes in the nebula, and for Fe+ to recombine.\nThis gives independent confirmation of the very large mass of the Homunculus,\nindicating a total of roughly 15--35 Msun (although we note reasons why the\nlower end of this range is favored). At the interface between the atomic and\nmolecular zones, we predict a sharp drop in the dust temperature, in agreement\nwith the bimodal dust color temperatures observed in the two zones. In the\nouter molecular shell, the dust temperature drops to nearly the blackbody\ntemperature, and becomes independent of grain size because of self-shielding at\nshorter UV wavelengths and increased heating at longer wavelengths. This\nrelaxes constraints on large grain sizes suggested by near-blackbody color\ntemperatures. Finally, from the strength of infrared [FeII] emission in the\ninner shell we find that the gas-phase Fe abundance is roughly solar. This is\nastonishing in such a dusty object, where one normally expects gaseous iron to\nbe depleted by two orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Oct 2006 21:23:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The difference is that the width of the peak\nbecomes larger being proportional to $f^2(T/J)^3$ rather than $f^4(T/J)^3$,\nwhere $f$ is the dimensionless coupling parameter.

While the ballistic conductance away from the\nDirac point is increased by Andreev reflection at the normal-superconductor\n(NS) interface, we find that the minimum conductivity stays the same. This is\nexplained as a manifestation of pseudo-diffusive conduction at the Dirac point.\nAs a generalization of our results for a ballistic system, we provide a\nrelation between the conductance G_NS of an arbitrarily disordered\nnormal-superconductor junction in graphene and its value G_N when both contacts\nare in the normal state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Oct 2006 11:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-07-09"}

These methods use more effective\ntransmission conditions between subdomains, and are also convergent without\noverlap for elliptic problems.

The proportion of the\npopulation vaccinated (i.e., the vaccination coverage) determines epidemic\nseverity. Above a critical vaccination coverage, epidemics are prevented; hence\nindividuals find it unnecessary to vaccinate. The adaptive dynamics of the\ndecisions directly affect influenza epidemiology and, conversely, influenza\nepidemiology strongly influences decision-making. This feedback mechanism\ncreates a unique self-organized state where epidemics are prevented. This state\nis attracting, but unstable; thus epidemics are rarely prevented. This result\nimplies that vaccination will have to be mandatory if the public health\nobjective is to prevent influenza epidemics. We investigated how collective\nbehavior changes when public health programs are implemented. Surprisingly,\nprograms requiring advance payment for several years of vaccination prevents\nsevere epidemics, even with voluntary vaccination.
