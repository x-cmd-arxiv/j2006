Assuming this to be true offers a simple geometric\nexplanation for several current puzzles in coronal physics, including: the\napparent uniform cross-section of bright threadlike structures in the corona;\nthe low EUV contrast (long apparent scale height) between the top and bottom of\nactive region loops; and the inconsistency between loop densities derived by\nspectral and photometric means. Treating coronal loops as a mixture of diffuse\nbackground and very dense, unresolved filamentary structures address these\nproblems with a combination of high plasma density within the structures, which\ngreatly increases the emissivity of the structures, and geometric effects that\nattenuate the apparent brightness of the feature at low altitudes. It also\nsuggests a possible explanation for both the surprisingly high contrast of EUV\ncoronal loops against the coronal background, and the uniform ``typical''\nheight of the bright portion of the corona (about 0.3 solar radii) in full-disk\nEUV images. Some ramifications of this picture are discussed, including an\nestimate (10-100 km) of the fundamental scale of strong heating events in the\ncorona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2006 17:21:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2007 05:13:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 2007 21:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The high-density sheets evolve and merge\nwith height into a final radial configuration constrained by the oberved\nposition of streamers stalks higher up in the corona.

So far there is no\ngenerally accepted theoretical explanation for torsional oscillations, even\nthough a close relation to the solar activity cycle is evident. On the\ntheoretical side non-kinematic dynamo models (including the Lorentz force\nfeedback on differential rotation) have been used to explain torsional\noscillations. In this paper we use a slightly different approach by forcing\ntorsional oscillations in a mean field differential rotation model. Our aim is\nnot a fully self-consistent model but rather to point out a few general\nproperties of torsional oscillations and their possible origin that are\nindependent from a particular dynamo model. We find that the poleward\npropagating high latitude branch of the torsional oscillations can be explained\nas a response of the coupled differential rotation / meridional flow system to\nperiodic forcing in mid-latitudes, of either mechanical (Lorentz force) or\nthermal nature. The speed of the poleward propagation sets constraints on the\nvalue of the turbulent viscosity in the solar convection zone to be less than\n3x10^8 m^2/s. We also show that the equatorward propagating low latitude branch\nis very unlikely a consequence of mechanical forcing (Lorentz force) alone, but\nrather of thermal origin due to the Taylor-Proudman theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2006 00:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We work out several finite dimensional examples that\nexhibit behaviors expected to be of importance in the quantization of gravity.\nWe also work out the case of BF theory. At the time of quantization, one can\ntake two points of view. The technique can be used to define, upon taking the\ncontinuum limit, the space of physical states of the continuum constrained\ntheory of interest. In particular we show in models that it agrees with the\ngroup averaging procedure when the latter exists. The technique can also be\nused to compute, at the discrete level, conditional probabilities and the\nintroduction of a relational time. Upon taking the continuum limit one can show\nthat one reproduces results obtained by the use of evolving constants, and\ntherefore recover all physical predictions of the continuum theory. This second\npoint of view can also be used as a paradigm to deal with cases where the\ncontinuum limit does not exist. There one would have discrete theories that at\nleast at certain scales reproduce the semiclassical properties of the theory of\ninterest. In this way the approach can be viewed as a generalization of the\nDirac quantization procedure that can handle situations where the latter fails.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2006 17:09:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Sep 2007 15:58:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

I begin with Luscher's ``Wilson bag'' integral over the\n3-index Chern-Simons tensor. The analogy with a Wilson loop as a charged world\nline in 2-dimensional $CP^{N-1}$ sigma models suggests that the Wilson bag\nsurface represents the world volume of a physical membrane.

These groups, whose geometrical\nmeaning is well known, exhaust the list of simple Lie groups for which the\nidentity representation is not isolated in the space of irreducible unitary\nrepresentations (i.e., which do not have the Kazhdan property) and hence there\nexist irreducible unitary representations of these groups -- so-called\n``special representations'' -- for which the first cohomology of the group with\ncoefficients in these representations is nontrivial. By technical reasons, it\nis more convenient to consider the groups O(n,1) and U(n,1). Most part of the\npaper is devoted to the group U(n,1). The main emphasis is on the so-called\ncommutative models of special and complementary series representations: in\nthese models, the maximal unipotent subgroup is represented by multiplicators\nin the case of O(n,1), and by the canonical model of the Heisenberg\nrepresentations in the case of U(n,1).

They are especially important for realization of\nnonlocal representations of current groups, which will be considered elsewhere.\n  We substantially use the ``density'' of the irreducible representations under\nstudy of SO(n,1): their restrictions to the maximal parabolic subgroup $ {{P}}\n$ are equivalent irreducible representations.
