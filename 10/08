For the Euler\nequations in 2-D gas dynamics, the classical linearized stability analysis on\ncompressible vortex sheets predicts stability when the Mach number $M>\\sqrt{2}$\nand instability when $M<\\sqrt{2}$; and Artola-Majda's analysis reveals that the\nnonlinear instability may occur if planar vortex sheets are perturbed by highly\noscillatory waves even when $M>\\sqrt{2}$. For the Euler equations in 3-D, every\ncompressible vortex sheet is violently unstable and this violent instability is\nthe analogue of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for incompressible fluids. The\npurpose of this paper is to understand whether compressible vortex sheets in\n3-D, which are unstable in the regime of pure gas dynamics, become stable under\nthe magnetic effect in 3-D magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). One of the main features\nis that the stability problem is equivalent to a free boundary problem whose\nfree boundary is a characteristic surface. Another feature is that the\nlinearized problem for current-vortex sheets in MHD does not meet the uniform\nKreiss-Lopatinskii condition. In this paper, we develop a nonlinear approach to\ndeal with these difficulties in 3-D MHD. We first carefully formulate the\nlinearized problem for the current-vortex sheets to show rigorously that the\nmagnetic effect makes the problem weakly stable and establish energy estimates,\nespecially high-order energy estimates, in terms of the nonhomogeneous terms\nand variable coefficients without loss of the order. Then we exploit these\nresults to develop a suitable iteration scheme of Nash-Moser-H\\\"{o}rmander type\nand establish its convergence, which leads to the existence and stability of\ncompressible current-vortex sheets, locally in time, in the 3-D MHD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Oct 2006 21:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We point out\nthat our function class incudes, among others, quasisubharmonic functions,\nnearly subharmonic functions (in a slightly generalized sense) and almost\nsubharmonic functions. We also give some basic properties of quasi-nearly\nsubharmonic functions. Second, after recalling some of the existing\nsubharmonicity results of separately subharmonic functions, we give the\ncorresponding counterparts for separately quasi-nearly subharmonic functions,\nthus improving previous results of ours, of Lelong, of Avanissian and of\nArsove. Third, we give two results concerning the subharmonicity of a function\nsubharmonic with respect to the first variable and harmonic with respect to the\nsecond variable. The first result improves a result of Arsove, concerning the\ncase when the function has, in addition, locally a negative integrable\nminorant.
