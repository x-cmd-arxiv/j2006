In\na standard scenario, the Poynting-Robertson force, possibly enhanced by the\nstellar wind drag, is responsible for the delivery of dust from outer regions\nof the disk to locations of external mean-motion planetary resonances; the\ncaptured particles then create characteristic ``clumps''. Alternatively, it has\nbeen suggested that the observed features in systems like epsilon Eri may stem\nfrom populations of planetesimals that have been captured in resonances with\nthe planet, such as Plutinos and Trojans in the solar system.

This means that\nspatially variable softening lengths can be used in N-body calculations without\nsecular increases in energy. The formalism requires the calculation of a small\nadditional term to the gravitational force related to the gradient of the\nsoftening length. The extra term is similar in form to the usual SPH pressure\nforce (although opposite in direction) and is therefore straightforward to\nimplement in any SPH code at almost no extra cost. For N-body codes some\nadditional cost is involved as the formalism requires the computation of the\ndensity via a summation over neighbouring particles using the smoothing kernel.\n  The results of numerical tests demonstrate that, for homogeneous mass\ndistributions, the use of adaptive softening lengths gives a softening which is\nalways close to the `optimal' choice of fixed softening parameter, removing the\nneed for fine-tuning. For a heterogeneous mass distribution (as may be found in\nany large scale N-body simulation) we find that the errors on the least-dense\ncomponent are lowered by an order of magnitude compared to the use of a fixed\nsoftening length tuned to the densest component. For SPH codes our method\npresents a natural and elegant choice of softening formalism which makes a\nsmall improvement to both the force resolution and the total energy\nconservation at almost zero additional cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2006 09:03:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

Its optical counterpart is\nsuggested to be an O9.5I supergiant star, which is the only remarkable object\nfound inside the ASCA error box. Aims: To detect and characterize new fast\noutbursts of AXJ1845.0-0433 and confirm its supergiant HMXB nature, using\nINTEGRAL and archival Swift XRT observations. Methods: We performed an analysis\nof INTEGRAL IBIS and JEM-X data with OSA 5.1 as well as an analysis of archive\nSwift XRT data. Results: We report on fast flaring activity from the source on\ntimescales of a few tens of minutes, the first to be reported since its\ndiscovery in 1993. Two outbursts have been detected by INTEGRAL (Apr 2005 and\nApr 2006) with similar peak fluxes and peak luminosities of 80 mCrab and\n9.3X10^35 erg s^-1 (20--40 keV), respectively.

The refined Swift XRT position\nof AXJ1845.0-0433 confirms its association with the supergiant star previously\nproposed as optical counterpart. Conclusions: Our INTEGRAL and Swift results\nfully confirm the supergiant HMXB nature of AXJ1845.0-0433 which can therefore\nbe classified as a supergiant fast X-ray transient. Moreover they provide for\nthe first time evidence of its recurrent fast transient behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2006 15:01:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2006 14:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Signal recognition and information processing is a fundamental\ncellular function, which in part involves comprehensive transcriptional\nregulatory (TR) mechanisms carried out in response to complex environmental\nsignals in the context of the cell's own internal state.
