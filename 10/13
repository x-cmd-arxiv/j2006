This\nargues against the suggestion that motions of protostars regulate the time\nscales over which significant (Bondi-Hoyle) accretion can occur. The most\ndeeply embedded YSOs are found in regions with high extinction, AV > 5, similar\nto the extinction threshold observed for the SCUBA cores. All the SCUBA cores\nwith high concentrations have embedded YSOs, but not all cores with low\nconcentrations are starless. An unbiased sample of 49 deeply embedded YSOs is\nconstructed.

We interpret this\ndark wedge as the shadow cast by the inner regions of a near-edge-on disk in UV\nlight, allowing the PAHs to be excited only outside of this shadow. The\npresence of a disk shadow strongly constrains the inclination as well as the\nposition angle of the disk. Although depending on the adopted PAH opacity, the\nabundance of PAHs in the surrounding cloud is constrained to 5+/-2% of the\ntotal dust mass, given the opacity. The extent of the nebulosity constrains the\ndensity of the gas surrounding the VV Ser disk to 500+/-200 cm-3 for a\ngas-to-dust ratio of 100.

Two primary order parameters with $X_3$ and\n$\\Delta_5$ symmetries are identified. They induce the phase transformation from\nthe high-temperature cubic to the low-temperature monoclinic structure. The\non-site Coulomb interaction $U$ between 3d electrons at Fe ions plays a crucial\nrole in this transition -- it amplifies the coupling of phonons to conduction\nelectrons and thus opens a gap at the Fermi energy. {\\it Published in Phys.\nRev.

In the\nfour-dimensional space-time of Einstein's wonderful theory of gravity, the\nsquared interval, in units such that the speed of light is unity, is the\ndifference between a squared time increment and the sum of three squares\nrepresenting the three dimensions of spatial change. More recently higher\ndimensional theories have been proposed, which aim to unify gravity with the\nother forces in nature. Such theories typically have a hyperbolic character in\nthat there is one time variable and many spatial variables (rather than just\nthree) in the formula for the squared interval. Here a new physical theory is\nadvanced, based on spinors, which clearly predicts that the basic extra\ndimensions are timelike: in its simplest form, there are three timelike and\nthree spatial degrees of freedom. It is expected that devices such as the Large\nHadron Collider will be sensitive to these new degrees of freedom and thus one\nmay hope that in the near future, this issue can be settled experimentally\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Oct 2006 03:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that the correlation functions of all, not only\ntopological (or BPS), observables may be studied explicitly in these models,\nand the spectrum may be computed exactly. An interesting feature is that the\nHamiltonian is not always diagonalizable, but may have Jordan blocks, which\nleads to the appearance of logarithms in the correlation functions. We also\nfind that in the models defined on Kahler manifolds the space of states\nexhibits holomorphic factorization. We conclude that in dimensions two and four\nour theories are logarithmic conformal field theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2006 18:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nalso prove that a Hermitian structure on the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$ with\nad-invariant metric induces a structure of the same type on the double Lie\nalgebra ${\\mathcal D}\\mathfrak{g}= \\mathfrak{g}\\oplus\\mathfrak{g}^*$, with\nrespect to the canonical ad-invariant metric of neutral signature on ${\\mathcal\nD}\\mathfrak{g}$. We show how to construct a 2n-dimensional Lie bialgebra of\ncomplex type starting with one of dimension 2(n-2). This allows us to determine\nall solvable Lie algebras of dimension $\\leq 6$ admitting a Hermitian structure\nwith ad-invariant metric. We exhibit some examples in dimension 4 and 6,\nincluding two one-parameter families, where we identify the Lie-Poisson\nstructures on the associated simply connected Lie groups, obtaining also their\nsymplectic foliations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2006 18:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
