The TRM curves scale with tw^\\mu,\nwhere \\mu is less than 1, which is known as a \"subaging\" effect. The question\nof whether this subaging effect is intrinsic, or due to experimental artifacts,\nremains as yet unanswered. One possible experimental origin of subaging arises\nfrom the cooling of the sample to the measuring temperature and it has been\nproposed that with fast enough cooling \\mu would go to 1 .

The trajectories of diffusing water\nmolecules are directly sampled, using random `walkers'. By counting how many of\nthese trajectories intersect the surface of the ice particle (which may be any\nshape) and how many escape outside a spherical boundary far from the particle,\nthe capacitance of a number of model ice particle habits have been estimated,\nincluding hexagonal columns and plates, `scalene' columns and plates, bullets,\nbullet-rosettes, dendrites, and realistic aggregate snowflakes. For ice\nparticles with sharp edges and corners this method is an efficient and\nstraightforward way of solving Laplace's equation for the capacitance. Provided\nthat a large enough number of random walkers are used to sample the particle\ngeometry the authors expect the calculated capacitances to be accurate to\nwithin ~1%. The capacitance for our modelled aggregate snowflakes (C/Dmax=0.25,\nnormalised by the maximum dimension Dmax) is shown to be in close agreement\nwith recent aircraft measurements of snowflake sublimation rates. This result\nshows that the capacitance of a sphere (C/Dmax=0.5) which is commonly used in\nnumerical models, overestimates the evaporation rate by a factor of 2. The\neffect of vapor `screening' by crystals growing in the vicinity of one another\nhas also been investigated. The results clearly show that neighbouring crystals\ngrowing on a filament in cloud chamber experiments can strongly constrict the\nvapor supply to each other, and the resulting growth rate measurements may\nseverely underestimate the rate for a single crystal in isolation (by a factor\nof 3 in our model setup).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Oct 2006 14:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 2007 11:04:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Jul 2007 13:37:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-17"}
