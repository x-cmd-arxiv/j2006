Here we examine the effect of a\nsharp increase in the external density on the light curve by considering, for\nthe first time, a full treatment of both the hydrodynamic evolution and the\nradiation in this scenario. To this end we develop a semi-analytic model for\nthe light curve and carry out several elaborate numerical simulations using a\n1D hydrodynamic code together with a synchrotron radiation code.Two spherically\nsymmetric cases are explored in detail: a density jump in a uniform external\nmedium, and a wind termination shock. Contrary to previous works, we find that\neven a sharp (step function) and large (by a factor of $a>>1$) increase in the\nexternal density does not produce sharp features in the light curve, and cannot\naccount for significant temporal variability. For a wind termination shock, the\nlight curve smoothly transitions between the asymptotic power-laws over about\none decade in time, and there is no rebrightening in the optical or X-rays to\nserve as a clear observational signature. For a sharp jump in a uniform density\nwe find that the maximal deviation $\\Delta\\alpha_max$ of the temporal decay\nindex $\\alpha$ from its asymptotic value, is bounded (e.g., $\\Delta\\alpha_max\n<0.4$ for $a=10$); $\\Delta\\alpha_max$ slowly increases with $a$, converging to\n$\\Delta\\alpha_{max} \\approx 1$ at very large $a$ values. Therefore, no optical\nrebrightening is expected here as well. In the X-rays, while the asymptotic\nflux is unaffected by the density jump, the fluctuations in $\\alpha$ are found\nto be comparable to those in the optical.

The surface\nbrightness profiles of galaxies with a B/PS bulge are also more complex, with\ntypically 3 or more clearly separated regions, including a flat intermediate\nregion (Freeman Type II profiles). Those radial breaks offer evidence for\nbar-driven transfer of angular momentum and radial redistribution of material.\nThe profiles also suggest a rapid variation of the scaleheight of the disc\nmaterial, contrary to conventional wisdom but again as expected from vertical\nresonances and instabilities in barred discs.

In\nthe first (PIM1), the dipole moments are only induced by the local electric\nfield; while in the other two (PIM1s and PIM2s), a short-range overlap induced\npolarization opposes the electrically induced dipole moments. In the PIM1 and\nthe PIM1s only the anions are assumed polarizable, while in the PIM2s both\nspecies are polarizable. Long molecular dynamics simulations show that the\nPIM2s is an unphysical model since, for some improbable but possible critical\nconfigurations, the ions become infinitely polarized. The results of using the\nPIM1, the PIM1s, as well as those of the simple RIM, have been compared for the\nstatic structure and ionic transport properties. The PIM1 reproduces the broad\nmain peak of the total structure factor present in the neutron diffraction\ndata, although the smoothed three-peak feature of this broad peak is slightly\noverestimated. The structural results for the PIM1s are intermediate between\nthose for the RIM and the PIM1, but fail to reproduce the experimental features\nwithin the broad principal peak. Concerning the ionic transport properties, the\nvalue of the conductivity obtained using PIM1 is in good agreement with\nexperimental values, while the self-diffusion coefficients and the conductivity\nfor the PIM1s are lower than the corresponding values using the PIM1 and the\nRIM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2006 08:35:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A\ncontrollable theory for strong correlations and their effects on EPI is\ndiscussed which is based on the 1/N expansion method in the t-J model. Strong\ncorrelations renormalize EPI and other charge-fluctuation properties (by\nincluding nonmagnetic impurity scattering) and the forward scattering peak\n(FSP) appears in the effective interactions. Pronounced FSP in EPI of HTSC\ncuprates reconciles many puzzling results.

The ARPES kink and the isotope effect in the nodal and anti-nodal\npoints and the collapse of the elastic impurity scattering in the\nsuperconducting state, are explained by this theory. It also explains why the\nnodal kink is not-shifted in the superconducting state while the anti-nodal\nkink is shifted by the maximal superconducting gap.

Since no implicit non-covariant gauge choices are involved in the\ndefinition of the operators, the anomaly is clearly separated from the issue of\noperator renormalization and can be understood in isolation, instead of\ninfecting the latter as in other approaches. Our method is of wider\napplicability to covariant theories that are not Weyl invariant, but where\ncovariant tensor operators are desired.\n  After constructing covariantly regularized vertex operators, we define a\nclass of background-independent path integral measures suitable for string\nquantization.
