Current models of galaxy formation consider two such\ntruncation mechanisms: strangulation, which acts on satellite galaxies, and AGN\nfeedback, which predominantly affects central galaxies. The efficiencies of\nthese processes set the blue fraction of galaxies as function of galaxy\nluminosity and halo mass. In this paper we use a galaxy group catalogue\nextracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to determine these\nfractions. To demonstrate the potential power of this data as a benchmark for\ngalaxy formation models, we compare the results to the semi-analytical model\nfor galaxy formation of Croton et al. (2006). Although this model accurately\nfits the global statistics of the galaxy population, as well as the shape of\nthe conditional luminosity function, there are significant discrepancies when\nthe blue fraction of galaxies as a function of mass and luminosity is compared\nbetween the observations and the model. In particular, the model predicts (i)\ntoo many faint satellite galaxies in massive haloes, (ii) a blue fraction of\nsatellites that is much too low, and (iii) a blue fraction of centrals that is\ntoo high and with an inverted luminosity dependence. In the same order, we\nargue that these discrepancies owe to (i) the neglect of tidal stripping in the\nsemi-analytical model, (ii) the oversimplified treatment of strangulation, and\n(iii) improper modeling of dust extinction and/or AGN feedback.

While strongly barred galaxies sometimes exhibit grand design\nstructure within the central 10 percent of D25, this structure rarely extends\nto within ~10 pc of the galaxy nucleus.

In the deep interior of a planet, an\nabsence of oxidative volatiles will cause U and Th to stay in a state of metal\nor low valance compounds with a big density. Consequently, they migrate to the\nbottom of its mantle first, and then are gradually sequestered to its liquid\nmetal core. Earth is rich in oxidative volatiles including water, therefore, U\nand Th in the core can be moved up by an internal circulation system consisting\nof the outer core, hot super plumes, asthenosphere and subduction zone (or cold\nsuper plumes). This internal circulation system is the key for the formation of\nplate tectonics, the geodynamo and the consequent geomagnetic field. Moreover,\nplentiful oxidative volatiles and water within Earth is the precondition to\nform such a circulation system. In the early stage (> 4 Ga), Mars developed an\nEarth-like internal circulation system due to relatively large amount of\noxidative volatile compositions coming from its building material. This would\nhave produced a dynamo and correspondingly an Earth-like magnetic field.\nHowever, this internal circulation system was destroyed by one or several giant\nimpact events in the early stage, which drove off these volatile compositions.\nThese events also shaped the striking hemispheric dichotomy structure on the\nMartian surface. The other result is that its dynamo and geomagnetic field have\nalso disappeared.

Our analysis is carried out within the theoretical framework developed\nby Randall et al., which includes full nonadiabatic effects. The goal of this\nanalysis is partial mode identification, i.e., the determination of the degree\nindex l of each of the observed pulsation modes. We assume possible values of l\nfrom 0 to 5 in our calculations. For each target star, we compute a specific\nmodel atmosphere and a specific pulsation model using estimates of the\natmospheric parameters coming from time-averaged optical spectroscopy. For\nevery assumed value of l, we use a formal chi-squared approach to model the\nobserved amplitude-wavelength distribution of each mode, and we compute a\nquality-of-fit Q probability to quantify the derived fit and to discriminate\nobjectively between the various solutions. We find that no completely\nconvincing and unambiguous l identification is possible on the basis of the\navailable data, although partial mode discrimination has been reached for 25\nout of the 41 modes studied. A brief statistical study of these results\nsuggests that a majority of the modes must have l values of 0, 1, and 2, but\nalso that modes with l = 4 could very well be present while modes with l = 3\nappear to be rarer. This is in line with recent results showing that l = 4\nmodes in rapidly pulsating B subdwarfs have a higher visibility in the optical\ndomain than modes with l = 3.

On the contrary, if alternating association is preferable\n(i.e. A--B bonds are stronger than A--A and B--B contacts) then the polymer\ntends to form a generally linear necklace structure (with, probably, some rear\nside branches and loops, which do not influence the overall characteristics of\nthe chain). The transition between cloverleaf and necklace states is studied in\ndetails and it is shown that it is a 2nd order phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2006 22:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Their most common use is to account\nfor within-subject correlation in longitudinal data analysis. They are also the\nstandard vehicle for smoothing spatial count data. However, when treated in\nfull generality, mixed models can also handle spline-type smoothing and closely\napproximate kriging. This allows for nonparametric regression models (e.g.,\nadditive models and varying coefficient models) to be handled within the mixed\nmodel framework. The key is to allow the random effects design matrix to have\ngeneral structure; hence our label general design. For continuous response\ndata, particularly when Gaussianity of the response is reasonably assumed,\ncomputation is now quite mature and supported by the R, SAS and S-PLUS\npackages. Such is not the case for binary and count responses, where\ngeneralized linear mixed models (GLMMs) are required, but are hindered by the\npresence of intractable multivariate integrals. Software known to us supports\nspecial cases of the GLMM (e.g., PROC NLMIXED in SAS or glmmML in R) or relies\non the sometimes crude Laplace-type approximation of integrals (e.g., the SAS\nmacro glimmix or glmmPQL in R). This paper describes the fitting of general\ndesign generalized linear mixed models. A Bayesian approach is taken and Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is used for estimation and inference. In this\ngeneralized setting, MCMC requires sampling from nonstandard distributions. In\nthis article, we demonstrate that the MCMC package WinBUGS facilitates sound\nfitting of general design Bayesian generalized linear mixed models in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2006 11:04:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

Such assumptions are too strong to generally hold. Over the last decades,\na number of full longitudinal data analysis methods have become available, such\nas the linear mixed model for Gaussian outcomes, that are valid under the much\nweaker missing at random (MAR) assumption.

We show how our\nexperimental setup, a quasi-2D \"liquid pool\" system, is adapted to the\ndetermination of these fields: the velocity and bubble deformations are easy to\nmeasure from 2D movies, and the pressure can be measured by exploiting a\nspecific feature of this system, a 2D effective compressibility. To describe\naccurately bubble rearrangements, we propose a new, tensorial descriptor. All\nthese quantities are evaluated via an averaging procedure that we justify\nshowing that the fluctuations of the fields are essentially random. The flow is\nextensively studied in a reference experimental case; the velocity presents an\novershoot in the wake of the obstacle, the pressure is maximum at the leading\nside and minimal at the trailing side. The study of the elastic deformations\nand of the velocity gradients shows that the transition between plug flow and\nyielded regions is smooth. Our tensorial description of T1s highlight their\ncorrelation both with the bubble deformations and the velocity gradients. A\nsalient feature of the flow, notably on the velocity and T1 repartition, is a\nmarked asymmetry upstream/downstream, signature of the elastic behaviour of the\nfoam. We show that the results do not change qualitatively when various control\nparameters vary, identifying a robust quasistatic regime.

We constructed a theoretical model that combines mechanics and\nbiophysics, and that is constrained by the observations of propulsion and\nmuscular velocities, as well as wavelength and amplitude of undulations.
