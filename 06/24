We demonstrate that, in conjunction with results from cosmic\nmicrowave background (CMB) experiments, the properties of dark energy can be\nestimated with very high precision with large-scale, fully 3D weak lensing\nsurveys. In particular, a 5-band, 10,000 square degree ground-based survey to a\nmedian redshift of zm=0.7 could achieve 1-$\\sigma$ marginal statistical errors,\nin combination with the constraints expected from the CMB Planck Surveyor, of\n$\\Delta$w0=0.108 and $\\Delta$wa=0.099 where we parameterize w by\nw(a)=w0+wa(1-a) where a is the scale factor. Such a survey is achievable with a\nwide-field camera on a 4 metre class telescope. The error on the value of w at\nan intermediate pivot redshift of z=0.368 is constrained to\n$\\Delta$w(z=0.368)=0.0175. We compare and combine the 3D weak lensing\nconstraints with the cosmological and dark energy parameters measured from\nplanned Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) and supernova Type Ia experiments,\nand find that 3D weak lensing significantly improves the marginalized errors. A\ncombination of 3D weak lensing, CMB and BAO experiments could achieve\n$\\Delta$w0=0.037 and $\\Delta$wa=0.099. Fully 3D weak shear analysis avoids the\nloss of information inherent in tomographic binning, and we show that the\nsensitivity to systematic errors is much less. In conjunction with the fact\nthat the physics of lensing is very soundly based, this analysis demonstrates\nthat deep, wide-angle 3D weak lensing surveys are extremely promising for\nmeasuring dark energy properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2006 19:36:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2006 17:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Two methods of spectral index analysis for HB9 are presented and\ncompared: one removes compact sources at both frequencies but is limited to the\nresolution of the 408 MHz image; the other removes compact sources only in the\n1420 MHz image so is effective at higher spatial resolution. The second allows\nmore detailed spectral index variation studies than the first. The two T-T plot\nmethods and new integrated flux densities give spectral index\n(S_{\\nu}\\propto\\nu^{-alpha}) for the whole of HB9 of 0.48+-0.03; and\n0.47+-0.06, respectively. These are lower than previous spectral index for HB9\n(alpha=0.61). Spatial variations of spectral index are derived using the second\nmethod and yield a steeper spectral index for interior regions than for the\nrim.

Previous work has shown that the\nlocal field version of $L^\\infty$ is the appropriate counterpart of $L^2$, and\nso the expected value of a local field-valued random variable is defined to be\nits ``projection'' in $L^\\infty$ onto the constants. Unlike the real case, the\nresulting projection is not typically a single constant, but rather a ball in\nthe metric on the local field. However, many properties of this expectation\noperation and the corresponding conditional expectation mirror those familiar\nfrom the real-valued case; for example, conditional expectation is, in a\nsuitable sense, a contraction on $L^\\infty$ and the tower property holds. We\nalso define the corresponding notion of martingale, show that several standard\nexamples of martingales (for example, sums or products of suitable independent\nrandom variables or ``harmonic'' functions composed with Markov chains) have\nlocal field analogues, and obtain versions of the optional sampling and\nmartingale convergence theorems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jun 2006 03:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The running time of this algorithm, the so-called {\\em\nmixing time} of $P$, is $O(\\delta^{-1} (\\log N + \\log \\epsilon^{-1}))$, where\n$\\delta$ is the spectral gap of $P$.\n  We present a natural quantum version of this algorithm based on repeated\nmeasurements of the {\\em quantum walk} $U_t = e^{-iPt}$. We show that it\nsamples almost uniformly from $S$ with logarithmic dependence on\n$\\epsilon^{-1}$ just as the classical walk $P$ does; previously, no such\nquantum walk algorithm was known. We then outline a framework for analyzing its\nrunning time and formulate two plausible conjectures which together would imply\nthat it runs in time $O(\\delta^{-1/2} \\log N \\log \\epsilon^{-1})$ when $P$ is\nthe standard transition matrix of a constant-degree graph. We prove each\nconjecture for a subclass of Cayley graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Jun 2006 01:09:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2006 10:08:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2006 17:37:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
