All galaxies where HI is detected also\ncontain ionised gas, whereas no HI is found around galaxies without ionised\ngas. Galaxies with regular HI discs tend to have strong emission from ionised\ngas. In these cases, the similar kinematics of the neutral hydrogen and ionised\ngas suggest that they form one structure.

The\nanalysis is done in the time-dependent local density approximation (TDLDA). It\nis shown that the direct two-photon population (DTP) and off-resonant\nstimulated Raman (ORSR) scattering can be effectively used for excitation of\nthe quadrupole states in high-frequency (quadrupole plasmon) and low-frequency\n(infrared) regions, respectively. In ORSR, isolated dipole particle-hole states\nas well as the tail of the dipole plasmon can serve as an intermediate state. A\nsimultaneous study of low- and high-frequency quadrupoles, combining DTP and\nORSR, is most effective. Femtosecond pulses with intensities $I = 2\\cdot\n10^{10} - 2\\cdot 10^{11} W/cm^2$ and pulse durations $T = 200 - 500$ fs are\nfound to be optimal. Since the low-lying quadrupole states are dominated by one\nsingle electron-hole pair, their energies, being combined with the\nphotoelectron data for hole states, allow to get the electron spectrum above\nthe Fermi level and thus greatly extend our knowledge on the single particle\nspectra of clusters. Besides, the developed schemes allow to estimate the\nlifetime of the quadrupole states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2006 15:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-26"}

The entanglement gap temperature, T_{E}, is\nfound to have a non-monotonic dependence on the value of $\\alpha$, the exchange\ncoupling inhomogeneity parameter. We next determine the variation of T_{E} as a\nfunction of S for a spin dimer, a trimer and a tetrahedron. The temperature\nT_{E} is found to increase as a function of S, but the scaled entanglement gap\ntemperature t_{E} goes to zero as S becomes large. Lastly, we study a spin-1\ndimer compound to illustrate the quantum complementarity relation. We show that\nin the experimentally realizable parameter region, magnetization and\nentanglement plateaus appear simultaneously at low temperatures as a function\nof the magnetic field. Also, the sharp increase in one quantity as a function\nof the magnetic field is accompanied by a sharp decrease in the other so that\nthe quantum complementarity relation is not violated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2006 08:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
