The Mbh-L relationship predicts that the most luminous BCGs may\nhave Mbh approaching 10^{10}M_sol, while the M-sigma relationship always\npredicts Mbh<3X10^9M_sol.

We want to investigate whether\nsatellite accretions indeed drive the growth of bulges, and whether they are\nconsistent with global scaling relations of bulges and discs.

The calculation is performed by taking\ninto account not only the logarithmic Cooper and Peierls channels, but also the\nnon-logarithmic Landau and finite momentum Cooper channels, which give relevant\ncontributions to the uniform response at finite temperatures.

Its key feature is an orthogonal beamforming (or precoding)\nconstraint, where each user selects a beamformer (or precoder) from a codebook\nof multiple orthonormal bases. In this paper, the asymptotic throughput scaling\nlaws for PU2RC with a large user pool are derived for different regimes of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the multiuser-interference-limited regime, the\nthroughput of PU2RC is shown to scale logarithmically with the number of users.\nIn the normal SNR and noise-limited regimes, the throughput is found to scale\ndouble logarithmically with the number of users and also linearly with the\nnumber of antennas at the base station. In addition, numerical results show\nthat PU2RC achieves higher throughput and is more robust against CSI\nquantization errors than the popular alternative of zero-forcing beamforming if\nthe number of users is sufficiently large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2006 19:56:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2006 20:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 May 2008 07:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-05"}

Since black holes are believed to violate global symmetries, particle\ndecays can violate lepton and baryon numbers.

The PDFs from discharges\nwithout particular control methods are found to be adequately described by a\nGamma function, consistently with the recent results by Graves et al [J.P.\nGraves, et al, Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 47, L1 (2005)]. On the other hand,\npulses with external methods for plasma control feature modified PDFs. A first\nempirical analysis suggests that they may be interpolated through a linear\ncombination of simple functions. An inspection of the literature shows that\nthis kind of PDFs is common to other devices as well, and has been suggested to\nbe due to the simultaneous presence of different mechanisms driving\nrespectively coherent bursts and gaussian background turbulence. An attempt is\nmade to relate differences in the PDFs to plasma conditions such as the local\nshift of the plasma column. A simple phenomenological model to interpret the\nnature of the PDF and assign a meaning to its parameters is also developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2006 09:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A set of\nnonlinear differential equations for the oscillator circuit is derived and\nintegrated numerically for comparison with circuit measurements. The agreement\nis very good for both the transient and steady-state responses. Unlike the\nstandard RLC circuit, the behavior of this circuit is amplitude dependent. In\nparticular for the transient response the oscillator makes a transition from\nunder-damped to over-damped behavior, and for the driven oscillator the\nresonance response becomes sharper and stronger as drive source amplitude\nincreases.

Here we present a case study where we positively answer\nthis question analytically for networks of spiking neural oscillators. First,\nwe present a method of finding the set of all networks (defined by all mutual\ncoupling strengths) that exhibit an arbitrary given periodic pattern of spikes\nas an invariant solution. In such a pattern all the spike times of all the\nneurons are exactly predefined. The method is very general as it covers\nnetworks of different types of neurons, excitatory and inhibitory couplings,\ninteraction delays that may be heterogeneously distributed, and arbitrary\nnetwork connectivities. Second, we show how to design networks if further\nrestrictions are imposed, for instance by predefining the detailed network\nconnectivity. We illustrate the applicability of the method by examples of\nErd\\\"{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi and power-law random networks. Third, the method can be\nused to design networks that optimize network properties.

Using variational principles, we\nshow that we can always obtain a quantum Monte-Carlo method where the quantum\nevolution of a system is replaced by jumps between density matrices of the form\n$D = |Q_a> <Q_b|$, and where the average evolutions of the moments of\n$A_\\alpha$ up to a given order $k$, i.e. $< A_{\\alpha_1} >$, $< A_{\\alpha_1}\nA_{\\alpha_2} >$,..., $< A_{\\alpha_1} ...

Then, a set of more and more elaborated stochastic approximations\nof a quantum problem is obtained which approach the exact solution when more\nand more constraints are imposed, i.e. when $k$ increases. The Monte-Carlo\nprocess might even become exact if the Hamiltonian $H$ applied on the trial\nstate can be written as a polynomial of $A_\\alpha$. The formalism makes a\nnatural connection between quantum jumps in Hilbert space and phase-space\ndynamics. We show that the derivation of stochastic Schroedinger equations can\nbe greatly simplified by taking advantage of the existence of this hierarchy of\napproximations and its connection to the Ehrenfest theorem.
