The light curve model\nfor this event predicts that the lens star should be separated from the source\nstar by ~6mas at the time of the HST images. If the lens star is a late G, K or\nearly M dwarf, then it will be visible in the HST images as an additional\nsource of light that is blended with the source image. Unless the lens and\nsource have exactly the same colors, its presence will also be revealed by a\nsystematic shift between centroids of the source plus lens in different filter\nbands. The HST data indicates both of these effects: the HST source that\nmatches the position of the source star is 0.21 magnitudes brighter in the\nACS/HRC-F814W filter than the microlensing model predicts, and there is an\noffset of ~0.7mas between the centroid of this source in the F814W and F435W\nfilter bands. We conclude the planetary host star has been detected in these\nHST images, and this identification of the lens star enables a complete\nsolution of the lens system. The lens parameters are determined with a Bayesian\nanalysis, averaging over uncertainties in the measured parameters, interstellar\nextinction, and allowing for the possibility of a binary companion to the\nsource star. This yields a stellar mass of M_* = 0.63(+0.07/-0.09) M_solar and\na planet mass of M_p = 2.6 (+0.8/-0.6) M_Jup at an orbital separation of 4.3\n(+2.5/-0.8) AU. Thus, the lens system resembles our own Solar System, with a\nplanet of ~3 Jupiter-masses in a Jupiter-like orbit around a star of two-thirds\nof a Solar mass. These conclusions can be tested with future HST images, which\nshould reveal a broadening of the blended source-plus-lens point spread\nfunction due to the relative lens-source proper motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2006 18:21:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2006 13:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This sample, which is purely magnitude limited, free of morphological\nor color selection biases, contains 130 broad line AGN (BLAGN) spectra with\nredshift up to 5. Our data are divided into a wide (Iab < 22.5) and a deep (Iab\n< 24) subsample containing 56 and 74 objects respectively. Because of its depth\nand selection criteria, this sample is uniquely suited to study the population\nof faint type-1 AGN. Our measured surface density (~ 472 +- 48 BLAGN per square\ndegree with Iab < 24) is significantly higher than that of any other optically\nselected sample of BLAGN with spectroscopic confirmation. By applying a\nmorphological and color analysis to our AGN sample we find that: (1)~23% of the\nAGN brighter than Iab=22.5 are classified as extended; this percentage\nincreases to ~42% for those with z < 1.6; (2) a non-negligible fraction of our\nBLAGN are lying close to the color space area occupied by stars in u*-g' versus\ng'-r' color-color diagram.

While the continuum shape is very similar to that of\nthe SDSS composite at short wavelengths, it is much redder than it at lambda >\n3000 A.

Here we develop a theory of inhomogeneous maps and apply the\ngeneral approach to modeling heterogeneous populations with discrete\nevolutionary time step. We show that the behavior of the inhomogeneous maps may\npossess complex transition regimes, which depends both on the mean and the\nvariance of the initial parameter distribution. The examples of inhomogeneous\nmodels are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Jun 2006 18:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Nevertheless, this complexity can be reduced\nif the desired state can be characterized by certain symmetries measurable with\nthe corresponding experimental setup. In this paper we give simple expressions\nto estimate the fidelity of multi-qubit state preparation for\nrotational-invariant, stabilizer, and generalized coherent states. We\nspecifically discuss the cat, W-type, and generalized coherent states, and\nobtain efficiently measurable lower bounds for the fidelity. We use these\ntechniques to estimate the fidelity of a quantum simulation of an Ising-like\ninteracting model using two trapped ions.
