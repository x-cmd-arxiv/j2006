MTs have also been implicated in higher neuronal\nfunctions, including memory, and the emergence of \"consciousness\". How MTs\nhandle and process electrical information, however, is heretofore unknown. Here\nwe show new electrodynamic properties of MTs. Isolated, taxol-stabilized\nmicrotubules behave as bio-molecular transistors capable of amplifying\nelectrical information. Electrical amplification by MTs can lead to the\nenhancement of dynamic information, and processivity in neurons can be\nconceptualized as an \"ionic-based\" transistor, which may impact among other\nknown functions, neuronal computational capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2006 07:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The corresponding\ncomputational problem is approximating an arbitrary unitary as a product in a\ntopological generating set of $SU(d)$. The problem is known to be solvable in\ntime $polylog(1/\\epsilon)$ with product length $polylog(1/\\epsilon)$, where the\nimplicit constants depend on the given generators. The existing algorithms\nsolve the problem but they need a very slow and space consuming preparatory\nstage. This stage runs in time exponential in $d^2$ and requires memory of size\nexponential in $d^2$. In this paper we present methods which make the\nimplementation of the existing algorithms easier. We present heuristic methods\nwhich make a time-length trade-off in the preparatory step. We decrease the\nrunning time and the used memory to polynomial in $d$ but the length of the\nproducts approximating the desired operations will increase (by a factor which\ndepends on $d$). We also present a simple method which can be used for\ndecomposing a unitary into a product of group commutators for $2<d<256$, which\nis an important part of the existing algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2006 16:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
