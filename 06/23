This\nradius behavior, which is due to the fact that the white dwarf is not fully\ndegenerate, has two important consequences on the evolution of the binary: 1)\nthe orbital period decreases, with a timescale consistent with the period\ndecrease of the binary RXJ0806.3+1527; 2) the mass transfer rate is a factor of\nabout 10 smaller than from a fully degenerate white dwarf, easing the problem\nconnected with the small X-ray luminosity of this object. The possibility that\nsuch evolution describes the system RXJ0806.3+1527 is also consistent with the\npossible presence of hydrogen in the optical spectrum of the star, whose\nconfirmation would become a test of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2006 06:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The\nmodels yield a galaxy luminosity function sensibly different from that of the\nUZC and are unable to reproduce the distribution of groups and their luminosity\ncontent. The discrepancy between the model and the UZC reduces substantially,\nif we redistribute the luminosity among the galaxies in the simulation\naccording to the UZC luminosity function while preserving the galaxy luminosity\nrank. The modified LambdaCDM model provides the best match to the UZC: the\nabundances of groups by harmonic radius, velocity dispersion, mass and\nluminosity are consistent with observations. We find that this model also\nreproduces the halo occupation number of groups and clusters. However, the\nlarge-scale distribution of groups is marginally consistent with the UZC and\nthe redshift-space correlation function of galaxies on scales larger than 6\nMpc/h is still more than 3-sigma smaller than observed. We conclude that\nreproducing the properties of the observed groups certainly requires a more\nsophisticated treatment of galaxy formation, and possibly an improvement of the\ndark matter model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2006 15:44:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2006 15:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The nGL film analog\nof the Raman G-band in graphite exhibits a Lorentzian lineshape whose center\nfrequency shifts linearly relative to graphite as ~1/n (for n=1 G-band\nfrequency ~1588 cm-1). Three weak bands, identified with disorder-induced 1st\norder scattering, are observed at ~ 1350, 1450 and 1500 cm-1. The 1500 cm-1\nband is weak but relatively sharp and exhibits an interesting n-dependence. In\ngeneral, the intensity of these D-bands decreases dramatically with increasing\nn. Three 2nd order bands are also observed (~2450, ~2700 and 3248 cm-1). They\nare analogs to those observed in graphite. However, the ~2700 cm-1 band\nexhibits an interesting and dramatic change of shape with n. Interestingly, for\nn<5 this 2nd order band is more intense than the G-band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2006 06:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

Multiaccess channels with fixed input distributions and\nmultiple-antenna broadcast channels are examples of such systems. Any interior\npoint of the sum-capacity facet can be achieved by time-sharing among corner\npoints or by an alternative method known as rate-splitting. The main purpose of\nthis paper is to find a point on the sum-capacity facet which satisfies a\nnotion of fairness among active users. This problem is addressed in two cases:\n(i) where the complexity of achieving interior points is not feasible, and (ii)\nwhere the complexity of achieving interior points is feasible. For the first\ncase, the corner point for which the minimum rate of the active users is\nmaximized (max-min corner point) is desired for signaling. A simple greedy\nalgorithm is introduced to find the optimum max-min corner point. For the\nsecond case, the polymatroid properties are exploited to locate a rate-vector\non the sum-capacity facet which is optimally fair in the sense that the minimum\nrate among all users is maximized (max-min rate). In the case that the rate of\nsome users can not increase further (attain the max-min value), the algorithm\nrecursively maximizes the minimum rate among the rest of the users. It is shown\nthat the problems of deriving the time-sharing coefficients or rate-spitting\nscheme can be solved by decomposing the problem to some lower-dimensional\nsubproblems. In addition, a fast algorithm to compute the time-sharing\ncoefficients to attain a general point on the sum-capacity facet is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Jun 2006 21:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-15"}

Loop equations aren't differential\nequations as they involve left annihilation, which doesn't satisfy the Leibnitz\nrule with concatenation. But left annihilation is a derivation of the\ncommutative shuffle product. Moreover shuffle and concatenation combine to\ndefine a bialgebra. Motivated by deformation quantization, we expand\nconcatenation around shuffle in powers of q, whose physical value is 1. At\nzeroth order the loop equations become quadratic PDEs in the shuffle algebra.\nIf the variation of the action is linear in iterated commutators of left\nannihilations, these quadratic PDEs linearize by passage to shuffle reciprocal\nof correlations.

Then, cheating attempts can be detected by monitoring the count rate\nin the vacant slots. The proposed scheme has better experimental feasibility\nthan previously proposed entanglement-based QSS schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2006 04:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The usual security proofs suppose that\nthe authorized partners, Alice and Bob, have a perfect knowledge and control of\ntheir quantum systems and devices; for instance, they must be sure that the\nlogical bits have been encoded in true qubits, and not in higher-dimensional\nsystems. In this paper, we present an approach that circumvents this strong\nassumption. We define protocols, both for the case of bits and for generic\n$d$-dimensional outcomes, in which the security is guaranteed by the very\nstructure of the Alice-Bob correlations, under the no-signalling condition. The\nidea is that, if the correlations cannot be produced by shared randomness, then\nEve has poor knowledge of Alice's and Bob's symbols. The present study assumes,\non the one hand that the eavesdropper Eve performs only individual attacks\n(this is a limitation to be removed in further work), on the other hand that\nEve can distribute any correlation compatible with the no-signalling condition\n(in this sense her power is greater than what quantum physics allows). Under\nthese assumptions, we prove that the protocols defined here allow extracting\nsecrecy from noisy correlations, when these correlations violate a Bell-type\ninequality by a sufficiently large amount. The region, in which secrecy\nextraction is possible, extends within the region of correlations achievable by\nmeasurements on entangled quantum states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2006 14:18:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
