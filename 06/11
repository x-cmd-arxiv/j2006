The hardness ratio is especially useful to distinguish\nbetween and categorize weak sources as a proxy for detailed spectral fitting.\nHowever, in this regime classical methods of error propagation fail, and the\nestimates of spectral hardness become unreliable. Here we develop a rigorous\nstatistical treatment of hardness ratios that properly deals with detected\nphotons as independent Poisson random variables and correctly deals with the\nnon-Gaussian nature of the error propagation. The method is Bayesian in nature,\nand thus can be generalized to carry out a multitude of\nsource-population--based analyses. We verify our method with simulation\nstudies, and compare it with the classical method. We apply this method to real\nworld examples, such as the identification of candidate quiescent Low-mass\nX-ray binaries in globular clusters, and tracking the time evolution of a flare\non a low-mass star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2006 22:12:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-04-26"}

The hitting time for a classical random\nwalk on a connected graph will always be finite. We show that, by contrast,\nquantum walks can have infinite hitting times for some initial states. We seek\ncriteria to determine if a given walk on a graph will have infinite hitting\ntimes, and find a sufficient condition, which for discrete time quantum walks\nis that the degeneracy of the evolution operator be greater than the degree of\nthe graph. The set of initial states which give an infinite hitting time form a\nsubspace. The phenomenon of infinite hitting times is in general a consequence\nof the symmetry of the graph and its automorphism group. Using the irreducible\nrepresentations of the automorphism group, we derive conditions such that\nquantum walks defined on this graph must have infinite hitting times for some\ninitial states. In the case of the discrete walk, if this condition is\nsatisfied the walk will have infinite hitting times for any choice of a coin\noperator, and we give a class of graphs with infinite hitting times for any\nchoice of coin. Hitting times are not very well-defined for continuous time\nquantum walks, but we show that the idea of infinite hitting-time walks\nnaturally extends to the continuous time case as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Jun 2006 23:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
