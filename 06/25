We describe our new\ncorrection scheme for the time-dependent ACS PSF based on observations of\nstellar fields. This is currently the only technique which takes the full time\nvariation of the PSF between individual ACS exposures into account. We estimate\nthat our PSF correction scheme reduces the systematic contribution to the shear\ncorrelation functions due to PSF distortions to < 2*10^{-6} for galaxy fields\ncontaining at least 10 stars. We perform a number of diagnostic tests\nindicating that the remaining level of systematics is consistent with zero for\nthe GEMS and GOODS data confirming the success of our PSF correction scheme.\nFor the parallel data we detect a low level of remaining systematics which we\ninterpret to be caused by a lack of sufficient dithering of the data.\n  Combining the shear estimate of the GEMS and GOODS observations using 96\ngalaxies arcmin^{-2} with the photometric redshift catalogue of the GOODS-MUSIC\nsample, we determine a local single field estimate for the mass power spectrum\nnormalisation sigma_{8,CDFS}=0.52^{+0.11}_{-0.15} (stat) +/- 0.07 (sys) (68%\nconfidence assuming Gaussian cosmic variance) at fixed Omega_m=0.3 for a\nLambdaCDM cosmology.
