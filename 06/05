Building upon the RXTE legacy, in the Cosmic Vision exercise, testing\nGeneral Relativity in the strong field limit and constraining the equation of\nstate of dense matter were recognized recently as key goals to be pursued in\nthe ESA science program for the years 2015-2025. This in turn identified the\nneed for a large (10 m2 class) aperture X-ray observatory. In recognition of\nthis need, the XEUS mission concept which has evolved into a single launch L2\nformation flying mission will have a fast timing instrument in the focal plane.\nIn this paper I will outline the unique science that will be addressed with\nfast X-ray timing on XEUS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2006 06:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Using\nspines, complexity, and Turaev-Viro invariants of 3-manifolds, we prove the\nfollowing results: 1) a minimal triangulation of a closed irreducible or a\nbounded hyperbolic 3-manifold contains no non-trivial k-normal sphere; 2) every\ntriangulation of a closed manifold with at least 2 tetrahedra contains some\nnon-trivial normal surface; 3) every manifold with boundary has only finitely\nmany triangulations without non-trivial normal surfaces. Here, triangulations\nof bounded manifolds are actually ideal triangulations. We also calculate the\nnumber of normal surfaces of nonnegative Euler characteristics which are\ncontained in the conjecturally minimal triangulations of all lens spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2006 09:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-13"}

Our approach is based on queueing theory,\nparticularly, the so-called renewal-reward theorem. For the first passage\nprocesses of the Sony Bank US dollar/Japanese yen (USD/JPY) exchange rate, we\nevaluate the average waiting time which is defined as the average time that\ncustomers have to wait between any instant when they want to observe the rate\n(e.g. when they log in to their computer systems) and the next rate change. We\nfind that the assumption of exponential distribution for the first-passage\nprocess should be rejected and that a Weibull distribution seems more suitable\nfor explaining the stochastic process of the Sony Bank rate. Our approach also\nenables us to evaluate the expected reward for customers, i.e. one can predict\nhow long customers must wait and how much reward they will obtain by the next\nprice change after they log in to their computer systems. We check the validity\nof our prediction by comparing it with empirical data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2006 15:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Apr 2007 16:31:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Oct 2007 17:26:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

One observation made in this paper is that strength of the daily\ntrend in the WIG20 dynamics systematically decreases when going from 2001 to\n2005. Another is that large events in the return fluctuations are primarily\nassociated with a few most collective eigensignals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2006 13:10:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2006 19:34:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Nov 2006 18:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-02"}

This work has been performed\nprincipally within the setting of cavity quantum electrodynamics with diverse\nphysical systems, including single atoms in Fabry-Perot resonators, quantum\ndots coupled to micropillars and photonic bandgap cavities, and Cooper-pairs\ninteracting with superconducting resonators. Experiments with single, localized\natoms have been at the forefront of these advances with the use of optical\nresonators in high-finesse Fabry-Perot configurations. As a result of the\nextreme technical challenges involved in further improving the multilayer\ndielectric mirror coatings of these resonators and in scaling to large numbers\nof devices, there has been increased interest in the development of alternative\nmicrocavity systems. Here we show strong coupling between individual Cesium\natoms and the fields of a high-quality toroidal microresonator. From\nobservations of transit events for single atoms falling through the resonator's\nevanescent field, we determine the coherent coupling rate for interactions near\nthe surface of the resonator. We develop a theoretical model to quantify our\nobservations, demonstrating that strong coupling is achieved, with the rate of\ncoherent coupling exceeding the dissipative rates of the atom and the cavity.\nOur work opens the way for investigations of optical processes with single\natoms and photons in lithographically fabricated microresonators.
