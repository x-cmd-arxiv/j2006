Indeed, the dark energy\nabundance at that epoch influences directly the lensing strength, which is\ninjected at about the same time, if the source is the CMB. We illustrate this\neffect focusing on the curl (BB) component of CMB polarization, which is\ndominated by lensing on arcminute angular scales. An increasing dark energy\nabundance at the time of equality with matter, parameterized by a rising first\norder redshift derivative of its equation of state today, makes the BB power\ndropping with respect to a pure LambdaCDM cosmology, keeping the other\ncosmological parameters and primordial amplitude fixed.
