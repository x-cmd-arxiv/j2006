We develop\nthe model proposed Gierlinski & Done (2004), which models the soft excess with\nheavily smeared, ionized, absorption, by including the emission that must be\nassociated with this absorption. We show that, rather than hindering the\nionized absorption model, the addition of the emission actually helps this\nmodel reproduce the soft excess. The emission fills in some of the absorption\ntrough, while preserving the sharp rise at ~1 keV, allowing the total model to\nreproduce the soft excess curvature from a considerably wider range of model\nparameters. We demonstrate that this model is capable of reproducing even the\nstrongest soft X-ray excesses by fitting it to the XMM-Newton EPIC PN spectrum\nof PG1211+143, with good results. The addition of the emission reduces the\ncolumn density required to fit these data by a factor ~2 and reduces the\nsmearing velocity from ~0.28c to ~0.2c.

An interesting issue arises as to relations of non-HBLR S2s\nwith other types of Seyfert galaxies and whether or not they can be included in\nthe unified model. We assemble two sub-samples consisting of 42 non-HBLR S2s\nand 44 narrow-line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s) with redshift $z\\le 0.05$ from published\nliteratures to explore this issue.

A small\nsize maximum with a narrow, 0.8 kms-1, C18O (3-2) spectral line with a peak\ntemperature of T_MB ~11 K was detected in CG 12 S. This maximum is modelled as\na 60'' to 80'' diameter (~0.2pc) hot (80 K < Tex < 200 K) ~1.6 Msun clump. The\nsource lies on the axis of a highly collimated bipolar molecular outflow near\nits driving source.

We find a wide range of polarization\nmorphologies, with each jet having a somewhat different relationship between\ntotal intensity and polarized flux and the polarization position angle. We find\ntwo trends in all of these jets. First, jet ``edges'' are very often associated\nwith high fractional optical polarizations, as also found in earlier radio\nobservations of these and other radio jets. In these regions, the magnetic\nfield vectors appear to track the jet direction, even at bends, where we see\nparticularly high fractional polarizations. This indicates a strong link\nbetween the local magnetic field and jet dynamics. Second, optical flux maximum\nregions are usually well separated from maxima in fractional polarization and\noften are associated with polarization minima. This trend is not found in radio\ndata and was found in our optical polarimetry of M87 with HST. However, unlike\nin M87, we do not find a general trend for near-90$^\\circ$ rotations in the\noptical polarization vectors near flux maxima.

In this perspective, the statistical features of the number of\nstates collected by the agents becomes a relevant quantity to understand the\ndynamics of the model, and the influence of topological properties on\nmemory-based models. By means of a master equation approach, we analyze the\ninternal agent dynamics of Naming Game in populations embedded on networks,\nfinding that it strongly depends on very general topological properties of the\nsystem (e.g. average and fluctuations of the degree). However, the influence of\ntopological properties on the microscopic individual dynamics is a general\nphenomenon that should characterize all those social interactions that can be\nmodeled by memory-based negotiation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Jun 2006 19:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Analytical results\nconcerning CSI feedback are derived by modeling quantized CSI as a first-order\nfinite-state Markov chain.

The essential effect of\nhaving noncommutative co-ordinates in this approach is to smear out matter\ndistributions on a scale associated with the turn-on of noncommutativity which\nwas taken to be near the 4-d Planck mass. In particular, NSS took this smearing\nto be essentially Gaussian. This energy scale is sufficiently large that in 4-d\nsuch effects may remain invisible indefinitely.

Both are asymptotically regular and sinusoidal with a phase difference\n(shift) that contains information about the scattering potential. Therefore,\nboth solutions are essential for scattering calculations. Various\nregularization techniques were developed to handle the singular solution\nleading to different well-established scattering methods. To simplify the\ncalculation the regularized solutions are usually constructed in a space that\ndiagonalizes the reference Hamiltonian. In this work, we start by proposing\nsolutions that are already regular. We write them as infinite series of square\nintegrable basis functions that are compatible with the domain of the reference\nHamiltonian. However, we relax the diagonal constraint on the representation by\nrequiring that the basis supports an infinite tridiagonal matrix representation\nof the wave operator. The hope is that by relaxing this constraint on the\nsolution space a larger freedom is achieved in regularization such that a\nnatural choice emerges as a result. We find that one of the resulting two\nindependent wavefunctions is, in fact, the regular solution of the reference\nproblem. The other is uniquely regularized in the sense that it solves the\nreference wave equation only outside a dense region covering the singularity in\nconfiguration space. However, asymptotically it is identical to the irregular\nsolution.

This optimization is shown to be\ncalculable via a semidefinite program (SDP), a well-established form of convex\noptimization with efficient algorithms for its solution.
