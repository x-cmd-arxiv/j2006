A long-standing question regarding this mechanism is how to stop the\nmigration before planets plunge into their central stars. In this paper, we\npropose a new, simple mechanism to significantly slow down planet migration,\nand test the possibility by using a hybrid numerical integrator to simulate the\ndisk-planet interaction. The key component of the scenario is the role of low\nviscosity regions in protostellar disks known as dead zones, which affect\nplanetary migration in two ways. First of all, it allows a smaller-mass planet\nto open a gap, and hence switch the faster type I migration to the slower type\nII migration. Secondly, a low viscosity slows down type II migration itself,\nbecause type II migration is directly proportional to the viscosity. We present\nnumerical simulations of planetary migration by using a hybrid symplectic\nintegrator-gas dynamics code. Assuming that the disk viscosity parameter inside\nthe dead zone is (alpha=1e-4-1e-5), we find that, when a low-mass planet (e.g.\n1-10 Earth masses) migrates from outside the dead zone, its migration is\nstopped due to the mass accumulation inside the dead zone. When a low-mass\nplanet migrates from inside the dead zone, it opens a gap and slows down its\nmigration. A massive planet like Jupiter, on the other hand, opens a gap and\nslows down inside the dead zone, independent of its initial orbital radius. The\nfinal orbital radius of a Jupiter mass planet depends on the dead zone's\nviscosity. For the range of alpha's noted above, this can vary anywhere from 7\nAU, to an orbital radius of 0.1 AU that is characteristic of the hot Jupiters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2006 16:11:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2007 17:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Both the coherent and incoherent structures in photoemission correspond\nto well screened states. The coherent structure (3d1/u(C)) is mostly due to a\nnon-local coherent screening, whereas the incoherent feature (3d1/u(L)) is\nmainly related to the ligand screening. The poorly screened state (3d0) forms\nthe lower Hubbard band and appears deeper in energy. The increased distortion\nin the series decrease the V-O-V angle and thus the non-local transfer integral\nT*. This produces the observed transfer of spectral weight from the coherent to\nthe incoherent structure. A further decrease of T* would eventually induce a\nbandwidth controlled metal-insulator transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2006 17:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Logical qubits are localized at the domain walls\nthat separate the two possible dimerized states. The domain walls can be moved\nto produce \"flying spin qubits\". The topological nature of these states makes\nthem stable against a wide class of perturbations. Pairs of domain walls can be\nused to generate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of entangled qubits. We discuss\nspeed limitations within an exactly solvable three-spin model and describe a\npossible physical realization using quantum dot arrays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Jun 2006 18:12:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2006 22:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
