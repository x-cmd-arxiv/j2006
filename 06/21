A Seyfert 2 nucleus that truly lacked a BLR, instead of\nsimply having it hidden, would be a so-called \"true\" Seyfert 2. No object has\nas yet been conclusively proven to be one. We present a detailed analysis of\nfour of the best \"true\" Seyfert 2 candidates discovered to date: IC 3639, NGC\n3982, NGC 5283, and NGC 5427. None of the four has a broad H-alpha emission\nline, either in direct or polarized light. All four have rich, high-excitation\nspectra, blue continua, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images showing them to\nbe unresolved sources with no host-galaxy obscuration. To check for possible\nobscuration on scales smaller than that resolvable by HST, we obtained X-ray\nobservations using the Chandra X-ray Observatory. All four objects show\nevidence of obscuration and therefore could have hidden BLRs. The picture that\nemerges is of moderate to high, but not necessarily Compton-thick, obscuration\nof the nucleus, with extra-nuclear soft emission extended on the\nhundreds-of-parsecs scale that may originate in the narrow-line region. Since\nthe extended soft emission compensates, in part, for the nuclear soft emission\nlost to absorption, both absorption and luminosity are likely to be severely\nunderestimated unless the X-ray spectrum is of sufficient quality to\ndistinguish the two components. This is of special concern where the source is\ntoo faint to produce a large number of counts, or where the source is too far\naway to resolve the extended soft X-ray emitting region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2006 18:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Instead dwarf galaxies become passive only once they\nbecome satellites within a more massive halo, by losing their halo gas\nreservoir to the host halo, or through other environment-related processes such\nas galaxy harassment and/or ram-pressure stripping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2006 14:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Exactly because LISA is a pathfinder\nfor a new scientific discipline -- gravitational wave astronomy -- LISA data\nprocessing and science analysis methodologies are in their infancy and require\nconsiderable maturation if they are to be ready to take advantage of LISA data.\nHere we offer some thoughts, in anticipation of the LISA Science Analysis\nWorkshop, on analysis research problems that demonstrate the capabilities of\ndifferent proposed analysis methodologies and, simultaneously, help to push\nthose techniques toward greater maturity. Particular emphasis is placed on\nformulating questions that can be turned into well-posed problems involving\ntests run on specific data sets, which can be shared among different groups to\nenable the comparison of techniques on a well-defined platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Jun 2006 03:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The quantum Drude model is very\ninstructive because the optical activity can be calculated analytically without\nfurther approximations apart from the Rosenfeld long wavelength approximation.\nWhile it was generally believed that this model, when treated correctly, is\noptically inactive, we show that it leads to optical activity when the motion\nof the particle is quantum mechanically treated.

The model is\ncompared with other one-electron models and it is shown that its predicted\noptical activity is qualitatively different from those of other one-electron\nsystems. The vanishing of optical activity in the classical zero-energy limit\nfor the Drude model is due to the localization of the particle at the\nequilibrium position, whereas in the analogous model of a particle moving\nfreely on a helix without a definite equilibrium position, optical activity\ndoes not vanish but the spectrum is rescaled.
