Moreover, several parameters of the\nNLR can be directly accessed. We here apply the same methods developed and\ndescribed for the Seyfert-2 galaxy NGC1386 to study the NLR of five other\nSeyfert-2 galaxies by using high-sensitivity spatially-resolved optical\nspectroscopy obtained at the VLT and the NTT. We probe the AGN-photoionisation\nof the NLR and thus, its ``real'' size using diagnostic line-ratio diagrams.We\nderive physical properties of the NLR such as reddening, ionisation parameter,\nelectron density, and velocity as a function of distance from the nucleus. For\nNGC5643, the diagnostic diagrams unveil a similar transition between line\nratios falling in the AGN regime and those typical for HII regions as found for\nNGC1386, thus determining the size of the NLR. For the other four objects, all\nmeasured line ratios fall in the AGN regime. In almost all cases, both electron\ndensity and ionisation parameter decrease with radius. Deviations from this\ngeneral behaviour (such as a secondary peak) seen in both the ionisation\nparameter and electron density can be interpreted as signs of shocks from the\ninteraction of a radio jet and the NLR gas. In several objects, the gaseous\nvelocity distribution is characteristic for rotational motion in an (inclined)\nemission-line disk in the centre.

Methods: For the three stars, we measured the radial velocity by\nfitting Gaussian curves to line profiles in the optical domain. In the case of\nthe massive binary HD15558, we also used a spectral disentangling method to\nseparate the spectra of the primary and of the secondary in order to derive the\nradial velocities of the two components. These measurements were used to\ncompute orbital solutions for HD15558. Results: For HD15570 and HD15629, the\nradial velocities do not present any significant trend attributable to a binary\nmotion on time scales of a few days, nor from one year to the next. In the case\nof HD15558 we obtained an improved SB1 orbital solution with a period of about\n442 days, and we report for the first time on the detection of the spectral\nsignature of its secondary star. We derive spectral types O5.5III(f) and O7V\nfor the primary and the secondary of HD15558. We tentatively compute a first\nSB2 orbital solution although the radial velocities from the secondary star\nshould be considered with caution.

Conclusions: We propose that\nHD15558 could be a triple system.

For an isolated system a single closed cycle of the pump changes\nthe expectation value of the spin at each end even when spin orbit interactions\nviolate the conservation of spin. A second cycle, however returns the system to\nits original state. When coupled to leads, we show that the $Z_2$ pump\nfunctions as a spin pump in a sense which we define, and transmits a finite,\nthough non quantized spin in each cycle. We show that the $Z_2$ pump is\ncharacterized by a $Z_2$ topological invariant that is analogous to the Chern\ninvariant that characterizes a topological charge pump. The $Z_2$ pump is\nclosely related to the quantum spin Hall effect, which is characterized by a\nrelated $Z_2$ invariant. This work presents an alternative formulation which\nclarifies both the physical and mathematical meaning of that invariant.

For non interacting electrons we derive a formula for the time reversal\npolarization which is analogous to the Berry's phase formulation of the charge\npolarization. For interacting electrons, we show that abelian bosonization\nprovides a simple formulation of the time reversal polarization.

Here, we investigate some properties of\nthe trapping/untrapping mechanism of a single particle into/outside the\ncluster. Since the single particle dynamics of the HMF model resembles the one\nof a simple pendulum, each particle can be identified as a high-energy particle\n(HEP) or a low-energy particle (LEP), depending on whether its energy is above\nor below the separatrix energy. We then define the trapping ratio as the ratio\nof the number of LEP to the total number of particles and the\n``fully-clustered'' and ``excited'' dynamical states as having either no HEP or\nat least one HEP. We analytically compute the phase-space average of the\ntrapping ratio by using the Boltzmann-Gibbs stable stationary solution of the\nVlasov equation associated with the $N \\to \\infty$ limit of the HMF model. The\nsame quantity, obtained numerically as a time average, is shown to be in very\ngood agreement with the analytical calculation.

The choice of this space is given the\ncharacter of first principle, justified solely by the consequences that can be\nderived from such choice and their consistency with experimental results. Given\na metric space of any dimension, one can define monogenic functions, the\nnatural extension of analytic functions to higher dimensions; such functions\nhave null vector derivative and have previously been shown by other authors to\nplay a decisive role in lower dimensional spaces. All monogenic functions have\nnull Laplacian by consequence; in an hyperbolic space this fact leads\ninevitably to a wave equation with plane-like solutions. This is also true for\n5-dimensional spacetime and we will explore those solutions, establishing a\nparallel with the solutions of the Dirac equation. For this purpose we will\ninvoke the isomorphism between the complex algebra of 4x4 matrices, also known\nas Dirac's matrices. There is one problem with this isomorphism, because the\nsolutions to Dirac's equation are usually known as spinors (column matrices)\nthat don't belong to the 4x4 matrix algebra and as such are excluded from the\nisomorphism. We will show that a solution in terms of Dirac spinors is\nequivalent to a plane wave solution.
