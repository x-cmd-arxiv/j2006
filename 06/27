Here we focus on the 19 E and S0 galaxies with an homogeneous set of\neight blue Lick indices. We explore the galaxy properties using six-parameter\nstellar population models from the literature, and describe an approach for\nfitting the models differentially, such that the largest systematic errors are\navoided. We find: (1) no differences between the stellar population parameters\nof Es and S0s, at fixed sigma; (2) the stars in the Es and S0s are uniformly\nold, consistent with previously published results using M/L ratios; (3) a\nsignificant correlation of [Z/H] with sigma, in a manner consistent with the\nobserved B-V colors of the galaxies; (4) no significant correlation of\n[alpha/Fe] with sigma; and (5) a significant anti-correlation of [alpha/N] with\n[Z/H], which we interpret as the signature of secondary nitrogen.

While the earlier regime\nof parametric resonant particle production and the later turbulent regime of\ninteracting fields evolving towards equilibrium are well identified and\nunderstood, the short intermediate stage of violent nonlinear dynamics remains\nless explored. Lattice simulations of fully nonlinear preheating dynamics show\nspecific features of this intermediate stage: occupation numbers of the scalar\nparticles are peaked, scalar fields become significantly non-gaussian and the\nfield dynamics become chaotic and irreversible. Visualization of the field\ndynamics in configuration space reveals that nonlinear interactions generate\nnon-gaussian inflaton inhomogeneities with very fast growing amplitudes. The\npeaks of the inflaton inhomogeneities coincide with the peaks of the scalar\nfield(s) produced by parametric resonance. When the inflaton peaks reach their\nmaxima, they stop growing and begin to expand. The subsequent dynamics is\ndetermined by expansion and superposition of the scalar waves originating from\nthe peaks. Multiple wave superposition results in phase mixing and turbulent\nwave dynamics. Thus, the short intermediate stage is defined by the formation,\nexpansion and collision of bubble-like field inhomogeneities associated with\nthe peaks of the original gaussian field. This process is qualitatively similar\nto the bubble-like inflaton fragmentation that occurs during tachyonic\npreheating after hybrid or new inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2006 19:02:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In common with the classical dynamics, prequantum dynamics transports\nfunctions on phase space, but add some phases which are important in quantum\ninterference effects. In the case of hyperbolic dynamical systems, it is\nbelieved that the study of the prequantum dynamics will give a better\nunderstanding of the quantum interference effects for large time, and of their\nstatistical properties. We consider a linear hyperbolic map M in SL(2,Z) which\ngenerates a chaotic dynamics on the torus. This dynamics is lifted on a\nprequantum fiber bundle. This gives a unitary prequantum (partially hyperbolic)\nmap. We calculate its resonances and show that they are related with the\nquantum eigenvalues. A remarkable consequence is that quantum dynamics emerges\nfrom long time behaviour of prequantum dynamics.
