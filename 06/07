The transfer code SEDONA has been developed to calculate the\nlightcurves, spectra, and polarization of aspherical supernova models. From the\nonset of free-expansion in the supernova ejecta, SEDONA solves the radiative\ntransfer problem self-consistently, including a detailed treatment of gamma-ray\ntransfer from radioactive decay and with a radiative equilibrium solution of\nthe temperature structure. Line fluorescence processes can also be treated\ndirectly. No free parameters need be adjusted in the radiative transfer\ncalculation, providing a direct link between multi-dimensional hydrodynamical\nexplosion models and observations. We describe the computational techniques\napplied in SEDONA, and verify the code by comparison to existing calculations.\nWe find that convergence of the Monte Carlo method is rapid and stable even for\ncomplicated multi-dimensional configurations. We also investigate the accuracy\nof a few commonly applied approximations in supernova transfer, namely the\nstationarity approximation and the two-level atom expansion opacity formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2006 17:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This suite of programs called SAPAC is made readily available\nto the astronomical community for extensive testing with the long-term goal to\nprovide the necessary tools for systematic distance surveys of early-type\ngalaxies using modern optical/NIR telescopes equipped with wide-field cameras.\nWe discuss the technical and scientific concepts of SAPAC and demonstrate its\ncapabilities by analysing deep B and R-band CCD images of 10 dwarf elliptical\n(dE) galaxy candidates in the Fornax cluster obtained with FORS1 at the VLT.\nAll candidates are confirmed as cluster members. We then turn our attention to\nthe innermost region of the Fornax cluster. A total of 29 early-type galaxies\ncloser than three cluster core radii (2 degrees) from the central galaxy\nNGC1399 have radial velocities and SBF distances. Their Hubble diagram exhibits\na pronounced S-shaped infall pattern suggesting a picture that Fornax is still\nin the process of formation during the present epoch through a general collapse\nand possible accretion of distinct groups of galaxies. The associated collapse\ntime is 2.9(+1.6, -0.9)Gyr. After cleansing our galaxy sample from a few\nkinematical outliers the true distance of the Fornax cluster core is determined\nat 20.13+-0.40 Mpc [(m-M)_0=31.51+-0.04mag]. Applying a bootstrap resampling\ntechnique on the distance distribution with individual distance errors taken\ninto account further reveals a small intrinsic cluster depth of\nsigma_int=0.74(+0.52,-0.74)Mpc in best agreement with the cluster's linear\nextension in the sky: sigma_R.A=sigma_DEC~=0.5Mpc.

In the ion momentum\nequations of the solar wind, the ion gyro-frequency is many orders of magnitude\nhigher than any other frequency. This requires that the difference between\nproton and alpha velocity vectors be aligned with the background magnetic\nfield. With the aid of this alignment condition, the governing equations of the\nmulti-fluid solar wind are derived from the standard transport equations. The\ngoverning equations are numerically solved along a prescribed meridional\nmagnetic field line located at colatitude $70^\\circ$ at 1AU and a steady state\nfast solar wind solution is found. A general analysis concludes, in agreement\nwith the Weber-Davis model, that the magnetic field helps the coronal plasma to\nachieve an effective corotation out to the Alfv\\'enic radius, where the\npoloidal Alfv\\'enic Mach number $M_T$ equals unity ($M_T$ is defined by\nequation (\\ref{eq:mach})).

We fail to detect intrinsic temporal variability\nof the magnetic structure over the 1.5-yr period of our spectropolarimetric\nobservations (in agreement with the stable temporal variations of the UV\nspectra), and infer that any differential surface rotation must be very small.\n  The topology of the extended magnetic field that we derive from the\nphotospheric magnetic maps is also more complex than a global dipole, and\nfeatures in particular a significantly warped torus of closed magnetic loops\nencircling the star (tilted at about 90deg to the rotation axis), with\nadditional, smaller, networks of closed field lines. This topology appears to\nbe consistent with the exceptional Xray properties of tauSco and also provides\na natural explanation of the variability observed in wind-formed UV lines.

The new element in this paper is\nthe use of a dynamical action principle that includes all the degrees of\nfreedom, matter as well as metric. The matter lagrangian defines a relativistic\nversion of non-viscous, isentropic hydrodynamics. The matter fields are a\nscalar density and a velocity potential; the conventional, four-vector velocity\nfield is replaced by the gradient of the potential and its scale is fixed by\none of the eulerian equations of motion, an innovation that significantly\naffects the imposition of boundary conditions. If the density is integrable at\ninfinity, then the metric approaches the Schwarzschild metric at large\ndistances. There are stars without boundary and with finite total mass; the\nmetric shows rapid variation in the neighbourhood of the Schwarzschild radius\nand there is a very small core where a singularity indicates that the gas laws\nbreak down. For stars with boundary there emerges a new, critical relation\nbetween the radius and the gravitational mass, a consequence of the stronger\nboundary conditions. Tentative applications are suggested, to certain Red\nGiants, and to neutron stars, but the investigation reported here was limited\nto polytropic equations of state. Comparison with the results of Oppenheimer\nand Volkoff on neutron cores shows a close agreement of numerical results.\nHowever, in the model the boundary of the star is fixed uniquely by the\nrequired matching of the interior metric to the external Schwarzschild metric,\nwhich is not the case in the traditional approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Jun 2006 18:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Chiral STFs are a class of\nnanoengineered materials whose microstructure comprises parallel helicoidal\nnanowires grown normal to a substrate. The nanowires are $\\sim$10-300 nm in\ndiameter and $\\sim1-10 \\mu$m in length. Durations of transmitted pulses tend to\nincrease with decreasing (free-space) wavelength of the carrier plane wave,\nwhile average speeds tend to increase with increasing wavelength. An increase\nin nonlinearity, as manifested by an intensity-dependent refractive index in\nthe frequency domain, tends to increase durations of transmitted pulses and\ndecrease average speeds. The circular Bragg phenomenon exhibited by a chiral\nSTFs manifests itself in the frequency domain as high reflectivity for normally\nincident carrier plane waves whose circular polarization state is matched to\nthe structural handedness of the film and whose wavelength falls in a range\nknown as the Bragg regime; films of the opposite structural handedness reflect\nsuch plane waves little. This effect tends to distort the shapes of transmitted\npulses with respect to the incident pulses, and such shaping can cause sharp\nchanges in some measures of average speed with respect to carrier wavelength. A\nlocal maximum in the variation of one measure of the pulse duration with\nrespect to wavelength is noted and attributed to the circular Bragg phenomenon.\nSeveral of these effects are explained via frequency-domain arguments. The\npresented results serve as a foundation for future theoretical and experimental\nstudies of optical pulse propagation through causal, nonlinear, nonhomogeneous,\nand anisotropic materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2006 15:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-12-07"}
