Non-LTE model atmosphere calculations\nhave been used to estimate effective temperatures (from either the helium\nspectrum or the silicon ionization equilibrium) and gravities (from the\nhydrogen spectrum). Projected rotational velocities have been deduced from the\nhelium spectrum (for fast and moderate rotators) or the metal line spectrum\n(for slow rotators). The observed Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams are compared\nwith theoretical predictions and some discrepancies including differences in\nthe main sequence luminosities are discussed. Cluster ages have been deduced\nand evidence for non-coeval star formation is found for all three of the\nclusters. Projected rotational velocities for targets in the older clusters,\nNGC3293 and NGC4755, have been found to be systematically larger than those for\nthe field, confirming recent results in other similar age clusters. The\ndistribution of projected rotational velocities are consistent with a Gaussian\ndistribution of intrinsic rotational velocities. For the relatively unevolved\ntargets in the older clusters, NGC3293 and NGC4755, the peak of the velocity\ndistribution would be 250km/s with a full-width-half-maximum of approximately\n180km/s. For NGC6611, the sample size is relatively small but implies a lower\nmean rotational velocity. This may be evidence for the spin-down effect due to\nangular momentum loss through stellar winds, although our results are\nconsistent with those found for very young high mass stars. For all three\nclusters we deduce present day mass functions with Gamma-values in the range of\n-1.5 to -1.8, which are similar to other young stellar clusters in the Milky\nWay (Abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2006 16:42:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
