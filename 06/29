In this paper we present the results from FUSE observations\nobtained in 1999, 2000, and 2002 and one far-UV observation obtained by\nORFEUS/BEFS in 1993 shortly before the first eruption of HD 5980.

This analysis shows that the wind of the eruptor obeyed a\nvery fast velocity law in 2002, which is consistent with the line-driving\nmechanism. Large amplitude line-profile variations on the orbital period are\nshown to be due to the eclipse of star B by the wind of star A, although the\neclipse due to gas flowing in the direction of star B is absent. This can only\nbe explained if the wind of star A is not spherically symmetric, or if the\neclipsed line radiation is \"filled-in\" by emission originating from somewhere\nelse in the system, e.g., in the wind-wind collision region. Except for a\nslightly lower wind speed, the ORFEUS/BEFS spectrum is very similar to the\nspectrum obtained by FUSE at the same orbital phase: there is no indication of\nthe impending eruption. However, the trend for decreasing wind velocity\nsuggests the occurrence of the \"bi-stability\" mechanism, which in turn implies\nthat the restructuring of the circumbinary environment caused by the transition\nfrom \"fast, rarefied wind\" to \"slow, dense wind\" was observed as the eruptive\nevent.

We do this by\nfirst constructing a generalized disk--jet theoretical framework in which some\nfraction of the total accretion power Pa is efficiently removed from the\naccretion disk by a magnetic torque responsible for jet formation. Thus, for\ndifferent black hole masses, mass accretion rates and magnetic coupling\nstrength, we self-consistently calculate the relative importance of the\nmodified disk spectrum, as well as the overall jet emission due to synchrotron\nand Compton processes. In general, transferring accretion power to a jet makes\nthe disk fainter and cooler than a standard disk at the same mass accretion\nrate; this may explain why the soft spectral component appears less prominent\nthan the dominant power-law component in most bright ULXs. We show that the\napparent X-ray luminosity and spectrum predicted by the microquasar model are\nconsistent with the observed properties of most ULXs. We predict that the radio\nsynchrotron jet emission is too faint to be detected at the typical threshold\nof radio surveys to date.

As the resonator frequency not only depends on the\nspeed of light but also on the resonator length, the quality of these\nmeasurements is very sensitive to elastic deformations of the optical resonator\nitself. As a consequence, a detailed knowledge about the deformations of the\ncavity is necessary. Therefore in this article we investigate the modeling of\noptical resonators in a space environment. Usually for simulation issues the\nFinite Element Method (FEM) is applied in order to investigate the influence of\ndisturbances on the resonator measurements. However, for a careful control of\nthe numerical quality of FEM simulations a comparison with an analytical\nsolution of a simplified resonator model is beneficial. In this article we\npresent an analytical solution for the problem of an elastic, isotropic,\nhomogeneous free-flying cylinder in space under the influence of a tidal\ngravitational force. The solution is gained by solving the linear equations of\nelasticity for special boundary conditions. The applicability of using FEM\ncodes for these simulations shall be verified through the comparison of the\nanalytical solution with the results gained within the FEM code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2006 21:33:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
