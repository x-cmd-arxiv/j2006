Aims: We seek to better understand the\ncomposition of transiting extrasolar planets by considering them as an\nensemble, and by comparing the obtained planetary properties to that of the\nparent stars. Methods: We use evolution models and constraints on the stellar\nages to derive the mass of heavy elements present in the planets.

Results: We show that the\nnine transiting planets discovered so far belong to a quite homogeneous\nensemble that is characterized by a mass of heavy elements that is a relatively\nsteep function of the stellar metallicity, from less than 20 earth masses of\nheavy elements around solar composition stars, to up to 100M for three times\nthe solar metallicity (the precise values being model-dependant).

We show that using the\nmodified estimator is practically equivalent to computing the full Likelihood\nof f_NL given the data. Thus other statistics of the data, such as the 4-point\nfunction and Minkowski functionals, contain no additional information on f_NL.\nIn particular, we explicitly show that the recent claims about the relevance of\nthe 4-point function are not correct. By direct inspection of the Likelihood,\nwe show that the data do not contain enough information for any statistic to be\nable to constrain higher order terms in the relation between the Gaussian field\nand the curvature perturbation, unless these are orders of magnitude larger\nthan the size suggested by the current limits on f_NL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2006 20:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Mar 2007 09:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

We find an upper limit to the distance of\n10^15 m, ruling out an origin in the narrow emission line region. In addition,\nan emission component producing strong radiative recombination continua of C VI\nand C V appears during the low state. This can be explained by emission from an\nionised skin of the accretion disk at a distance of only ~4x10^12 m from the\nblack hole. Finally, the spectra contain a broad relativistic O VIII line with\nproperties similar to what was found before in this source with XMM-Newton;\nthis line has disappeared during the low flux state, consistent with the\ndisappearance of the inner part of the accretion disk during that low flux\nstate.

This is considered as evidence that in\nthe non relaxor case memory is indeed due to slow migration of defects, while\nin the La rich case it is intrinsic of the relaxor state, even above the\ntemperature of the susceptibility maximum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2006 09:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-23"}

This is justified by the\nnonlinear and nonperturbative dynamics of QCD. None of physical\nobservables/processes in low-energy QCD will be directly affected by such a\ntemporary violation of color gauge invariance/symmetry. No\ntruncations/approximations and no special gauge choice are made for the\nregularized skeleton loop integrals, contributing to the full gluon\nself-energy, which enters the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the full gluon\npropagator. In order to make the existence of a mass gap perfectly clear the\ncorresponding subtraction procedure is introduced. All this allows one to\nestablish the general structure of the full gluon propagator and the\ncorresponding gluon Schwinger-Dyson equation in the presence of a mass gap. It\nis mainly generated by the nonlinear interaction of massless gluon modes.The\nphysical meaning of the mass gap is to be responsible for the large-scale\n(low-energy/momentum), i.e., nonperturbative structure of the true QCD vacuum.\nIn the presence of a mass gap two different types of solutions for the full\ngluon propagator are possible. The massive solution leads to an effective gluon\nmass, which explicitly depends on the gauge-fixing parameter. This solution\nbecomes smooth at small gluon momentum in the Landau gauge. The general\niteration solution is always severely singular at small gluon momentum, i.e.,\nthe gluons remain massless, and this does not depend on the gauge choice. We\nalso formulate a general method how to restore the transversality of the gluon\npropagator relevant for nonperturbative QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2006 14:00:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2006 12:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2006 15:38:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 19 Oct 2006 12:16:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 15 Nov 2006 09:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Then we introduce a PAC-Bayesian point of\nview on transductive learning and use it to improve on known Vapnik's\ngeneralization bounds, extending them to the case when the sample is\nindependent but not identically distributed. Eventually we review briefly the\nconstruction of Support Vector Machines and show how to derive generalization\nbounds for them, measuring the complexity either through the number of support\nvectors or through transductive or inductive margin estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 May 2006 18:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

The Werner state is recognized as a rational solution of\nthe Yang--Baxter equation, and the isotropic state with an adjustable parameter\nis found to form a braid representation. The set of permutation's partial\ntransposes is an algebra called the \"PPT\" algebra which guides the construction\nof multipartite symmetric states. The virtual knot theory having permutation as\na virtual crossing provides a topological language describing quantum\ncomputation having permutation as a swap gate. In this paper, permutation's\npartial transpose is identified with an idempotent of the Temperley--Lieb\nalgebra. The algebra generated by permutation and its partial transpose is\nfound to be the Brauer algebra. The linear combinations of identity,\npermutation and its partial transpose can form various projectors describing\ntangles; braid representations; virtual braid representations underlying common\nsolutions of the braid relation and Yang--Baxter equations; and virtual\nTemperley--Lieb algebra which is articulated from the graphical viewpoint. They\nlead to our drawing a picture called the \"ABPK\" diagram describing knot theory\nin terms of its corresponding algebra, braid group and polynomial invariant.\nThe paper also identifies nontrivial unitary braid representations with\nuniversal quantum gates, and derives a Hamiltonian to determine the evolution\nof a universal quantum gate, and further computes the Markov trace in terms of\na universal quantum gate for a link invariant to detect linking numbers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Jun 2006 02:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Assuming that $F_a$ originates\nfrom a potential $\\propto x^2$ ($x$ being a small change in $d$), we find that:\n(i) the particle and strained box assume a mutually bound state (under the\nequilibrium between $F_o$ and $F_a$) with binding energy $\\Delta{E} =\n-\\epsilon_o'\\Delta{d}/d'$ (with $\\epsilon_o' = h^2/8md'^2$ being the ground\nstate energy of the particle in the strained box), (ii) the box size oscillates\naround $d'$ when the said equilibrium is disturbed, (iii) an exchange of energy\nbetween the particle and the strained box occurs during such oscillations, and\n(iv) the particle, having collisional motion in its excited states, assumes\ncollisionless motion in its ground state.

We showed that in\na single atom there is no perfect CPT when the atomic transitions are affected\nby the thermal field. The perfect CPT may occur when only one of the two atomic\ntransitions is affected by the thermal field. In the case when both atomic\ntransitions are affected by the thermal field, we demonstrated that regardless\nof the intensity of the thermal field the destructive effect on the CPT can be\ncircumvented by the collective behavior of the atoms. An analytic expression\nwas obtained for the populations of the upper atomic levels which can be\nconsidered as a measure of the level of thermal decoherence. The results show\nthat the collective interaction between the atoms can significantly enhance the\npopulation trapping in that the population of the upper state decreases with\nincreased number of atoms. The physical origin of this feature was explained by\nthe semiclassical dressed atom model of the system.
