All measurements were done both at ambient and\nunder applied pressure. At ambient pressure, a ferromagnetic state is observed\nbelow the Curie temperature (T$_{\\rm C}$ = 70 K). The ordered magnetic moments\nat 1.7 K are parallel and equal to 5.7(5) $\\mu_{\\rm B}$ and 0.8(2) $\\mu_{\\rm\nB}$ for Gd and Mo, respectively. The relaxation rate measured by $\\mu$SR\nevidences strong spin fluctuations below T$_{\\rm C}$ and down to the lowest\ntemperature (6.6 K). A spin reorientation occurs in the range 20\nK$<$T$<$T$_{\\rm C}$. The ferromagnetic state is strongly unstable under\npressure. T$_{\\rm C}$ sharply decreases (down to 38 K at 1.3 GPa) and Bragg\npeaks start to coexist with mesoscopic ferromagnetic correlations. The ordered\nmoments decrease under pressure. At 2.7 GPa long range magnetic order\ncompletely breaks down. In this spin glass state, Gd-Gd spin correlations\nremain ferromagnetic with a correlation length limited to the fourth neighbor,\nand Gd-Mo spin correlations turn to antiferromagnetic. The unique combination\nof three microscopic probes under pressure provides a detailed description of\nthe magnetic transition, crucial for further theories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2006 16:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Some of them can be ferroelectric and ferromagnetic and,\nfor example, provide the unique opportunity of encoding information\nindependently in electric polarization and magnetization to obtain four\ndifferent logic states. However, schemes allowing a simple electrical readout\nof these different states have not been demonstrated so far. In this article,\nwe show that this can be achieved if a multiferroic material is used as the\ntunnel barrier in a magnetic tunnel junction. We demonstrate that thin films of\nferromagnetic-ferroelectric La0.1Bi0.9MnO3 (LBMO) retain both ferroic\nproperties down to a thickness of only 2 nm. We have used such films as\nspin-filtering tunnel barriers the magnetization and electric polarization of\nwhich can be switched independently. In that case, the tunnel current across\nthe structure is controlled by both the magnetic and ferroelectric\nconfiguration of the barrier, which gives rise to four distinct resistance\nstates. This can be explained by the combination of spin filtering by the\nferromagnetic LBMO barrier and the partial charge screening of electrical\ncharges at the barrier/electrode interfaces due to ferroelectricity. We\nanticipate our results to be a starting point for more studies on the interplay\nbetween ferroelectricity and spin-dependent tunneling, and for the use of\nnanometric multiferroic elements in prototype devices.

The idea is first to propose a repositioning of\nthe maxilla, via the introduction of a 3D cephalometry, applied to a 3D virtual\nmodel of the patient's skull. Then, orthodontic data are integrated into this\nmodel, thanks to optical measurements of teeth plaster casts. Materials and\nMethods : The feasibility of the maxillo-facial demonstrator was first\nevaluated on a dry skull. To simulate malformations (and thus to simulate a\n\"real\" patient), the skull was modified and manually cut by the surgeon, in\norder to generate a given maxillo-facial malformation (with asymmetries in the\nsagittal, frontal and axial planes). Results : The validation of our simulator\nconsisted in evaluating its ability to propose a bone repositioning diagnosis\nthat will put the skull as it was in its original configuration. A first\nqualitative validation is provided in this paper, with a 1.5-mm error in the\nrepositioning diagnosis. Conclusions : These results mainly validate the\nconcept of a maxillo-facial numerical simulator that integrates 3D cephalometry\nand guarantees a correct dental occlusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Jun 2006 13:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
