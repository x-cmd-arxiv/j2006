With the discovery of optical afterglows and counterparts to bursts\nin the last few years, enabling the determination of significant redshifts for\nthese sources, it is anticipated that profound spectral attenuation will arise\nin the Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST) energy band of 30 MeV-300\nGeV for many if not most bursts. This paper explores time-dependent\nexpectations for burst spectral properties in the EGRET/GLAST band, focusing on\nhow attenuation of photons by pair creation internal to the source generates\ndistinctive spectral signatures. The energy of spectral breaks and the\nassociated spectral indices provide valuable information that constrains the\nbulk Lorentz factor of the GRB outflow at a given time. Moreover, the distinct\ntemporal behavior that is present for internal attenuation is easily\ndistinguished from extrinsic absorption due to intervening cosmic background\nfields.

The focus of\nour study was to investigate whether this range was associated with a secular\npattern in the length of the sunspot cycle. To provide a basis for the analysis\nof the long-term behavior of the Sun, we analyzed archival data of sunspot\nnumbers from 1700 - 2005 and sunspot areas from 1874 - 2005. The independent\ntechniques of power spectrum analysis and phase dispersion minimization were\nused to confirm the $\\sim$11-year Schwabe Cycle, and to illustrate the large\nrange in the length of this cycle. Long-term cycles were identified in archival\ndata from 1610 -- 2000 using median trace analyses of the length of the cycle,\nand from power spectrum analyses of the (O-C) residuals of the dates of sunspot\nminima and maxima. The median trace analysis suggested that the cycle length\nhad a period of 183 - 243 years, while the more precise power spectrum analysis\nidentified a period of 188 $\\pm$ 38 years. We found that the 188-year cycle was\nconsistent with the variation of sunspot numbers and seems to be related to the\nSchwabe Cycle. We found a correlation between the times of historic minima and\nthe length of the sunspot cycle such that the length of the cycle was usually\nhighest when the actual number of sunspots was lowest. The cycle length was\ngrowing during the Maunder Minimum when there were almost no sunspots visible\non the Sun.

Twelve new periodic stars have been\nfound in the last two years, bringing the total discovered by this program to\n40. In addition, we confirm 16 of the periods reported by others and resolve\nsome discrepancies. The total number of known rotation periods in the cluster,\nfrom all studies has now reached 70. This is sufficient to demonstrate that the\nparent population of K5-M2 stars is rotationally indistinguishable from that in\nthe Orion Nebula Cluster even though their radii are 20% smaller and they would\nbe expected to spin about twice as fast if angular momentum were conserved. The\nmedian radius and, therefore, inferred age of the IC 348 stars actually closely\nmatches that of NGC 2264, but the stars spin significantly more slowly. This\nsuggests that another factor besides mass and age plays a role in establishing\nthe rotation properties within a cluster and we suggest that it is environment.\nIf disk locking were to persist for longer times in less harsh environments,\nbecause the disks themselves persist for longer times, it could explain the\ngenerally slower rotation rates observed for stars in this cluster, whose\nearliest type star is of class B5. We have also obtained radial velocities, the\nfirst for PMS stars in IC348, and v sin i measurements for 30 cluster stars to\nassist in the study of rotation and as an independent check on stellar radii.\nSeveral unusual variable stars are discussed; in some or all cases their\nbehavior may be linked to occultations by circumstellar material.

Glutathione is known to be the main agent\nresponsible for the excretion of mercury (we refer to \\cite{Thim05},\n\\cite{ZalBar99} and \\cite{Lyn02}). It has also been shown that mercury inhibits\nglutathione synthetase (an enzyme acting in the synthesization of Glutathione),\ntherefore leading to decreased glutathione levels\n  (we refer to \\cite{Thim05}, \\cite{GeGe05}, \\cite{GeGe06} and \\cite{RDeth04}).\nMercury also interferes with the production of heme in the porphyrin pathway\n\\cite{WoMaEc93}. Heme is needed for biological energy production and ability to\ndetox organic toxins via the P450 enzymes \\cite{Boy06}. The purpose of this\npaper is to show that body's response to mercury exposure is hysteretic, i.e.\nwhen this feedback of mercury on its main detoxifying agents is strong enough\nthen mercury body burden has two points of equilibrium: one with normal\nabilities to detoxify and low levels of mercury and one with inhibited\nabilities to detoxify and high levels of mercury. Furthermore, a small increase\nof body's mercury burden may not be sufficient to trigger observable neurotoxic\neffects but it may be sufficient to act as a switch leading to an accumulation\nof mercury in the body through environmental exposure until its toxicity\nbecomes manifest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2006 22:49:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2006 17:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Jul 2006 00:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 19 Oct 2007 04:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-10"}

In\nstandard single mode cavity QED, three important rates characterize the system:\nthe QD-cavity coupling rate g, the cavity decay rate kappa, and the QD\ndephasing rate gamma_perpendicular. A more accurate model of the microdisk\ncavity includes two additional features. The first is a second cavity mode that\ncan couple to the QD, which for an ideal microdisk corresponds to a traveling\nwave WGM propagating counter to the first WGM. The second feature is a coupling\nbetween these two traveling wave WGMs, at a rate beta, due to backscattering\ncaused by surface roughness that is present in fabricated devices. We consider\nthe transmitted and reflected signals from the cavity for different parameter\nregimes of {g,beta,kappa,gamma_perpendicular}. A result of this analysis is\nthat even in the presence of negligible roughness induced backscattering, a\nstrongly coupled QD mediates coupling between the traveling wave WGMs,\nresulting in an enhanced effective coherent coupling rate g = sqrt(2)*g0\ncorresponding to that of a standing wave WGM with an electric field maximum at\nthe position of the QD. In addition, analysis of the second-order correlation\nfunction of the reflected signal from the cavity indicates that regions of\nstrong photon antibunching or bunching may be present depending upon the\nstrength of coupling of the QD to each of the cavity modes. Such intensity\ncorrelation information will likely be valuable in interpreting experimental\nmeasurements of a strongly-coupled QD to a bi-modal WGM cavity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Jun 2006 17:30:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Jun 2006 02:48:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2006 17:35:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 2007 03:14:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
