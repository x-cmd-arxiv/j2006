The high photon\nenergies available at the VUV-FEL increase substantially the expected photon\nregeneration rate in the mass range implied by the PVLAS anomaly, in comparison\nto the rate expected at visible lasers of similar power.

At large separations, Y-shape flux-tube\nformation is observed. T-shaped paths are observed to relax towards a Y-shaped\ntopology, whereas L-shaped paths give rise to a large potential energy. We do\nnot find any evidence for the formation of a Delta-shaped flux-tube (empty\ntriangle) distribution. However, at small quark separations, we observe an\nexpulsion of gluon-field fluctuations in the shape of a filled triangle with\nmaximal expulsion at the centre of the triangle. Having identified the precise\ngeometry of the flux distribution, we are able to perform quantitative\ncomparison between the length of the flux-tube and the associated static quark\npotential. For every source configuration considered we find a universal string\ntension, and conclude that, for large quark separations, the ground state\npotential is that which minimizes the length of the flux-tube.

These\nare natural in heterotic M-theory where the warping shrinks the Calabi-Yau\nvolume along S^1/Z_2. Combined with H-flux, open M2-instantons and hidden\nsector gaugino condensation it leads to a superpotential W which stabilizes S\nsimilar like a racetrack but without the need for multi gaugino condensation.\nMoreover, W contains two competing non-perturbative effects which stabilize T.\nWe analyze the potential and superpotentials to show that it leads to heterotic\nde Sitter vacua with broken supersymmetry through non-vanishing F-terms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Jun 2006 04:23:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Sep 2007 08:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

It is not clear, however, how such dramatic\nevolutionary process has contributed to shape the large scale topology of\nprotein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. We propose and analytically solve a\ngeneric model of PPI network evolution under successive whole genome\nduplications. This demonstrates that the observed scale-free degree\ndistributions and conserved multi-protein complexes may have concomitantly\narised from i) intrinsic exponential dynamics of PPI network evolution and ii)\nasymmetric divergence of gene duplicates. This requirement of asymmetric\ndivergence is in fact \"spontaneously\" fulfilled at the level of protein-binding\ndomains. In addition, domain shuffling of multi-domain proteins is shown to\nprovide a powerful combinatorial source of PPI network innovation, while\npreserving essential structures of the underlying single-domain interaction\nnetwork. Finally, large scale features of PPI networks reflecting the\n\"combinatorial logic\" behind direct and indirect protein interactions are well\nreproduced numerically with only two adjusted parameters of clear biological\nsignificance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Jun 2006 23:58:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
