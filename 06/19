Here we focus on\nthe study of galaxy's scale dark matter halos with galaxy-galaxy lensing\ntechniques: observing the shapes of distant background galaxies which have been\nlensed by foreground galaxies allows us to map the mass distribution of the\nforeground galaxies. The lensing effect is small compared to the intrinsic\nellipticity distribution of galaxies, thus a statistical approach is needed to\nderive some constraints on an average lens population. An advantage of this\nmethod is that it provides a probe of the gravitational potential of the halos\nof galaxies out to very large radii, where few classical methods are viable,\nsince dynamical and hydrodynamical tracers of the potential cannot be found at\nthis radii. We will begin by reviewing the detections of galaxy-galaxy lensing\nobtained so far.

This is because 75% of the\ninjected energy goes to the velocities of escaping stars, that are higher than\nthe escape velocity. We derive an expression for the cluster disruption time\n(t_dis) based on the mass loss from the simulations, taking into account the\neffect of gravitational focusing by the GMC. The disruption time depends on the\ncluster mass (M_c) and half-mass radius (r_h) as t_dis=2.0 S (M_c/10^4\nM_sun)(3.75 pc/r_h)^3 Gyr, with S=1 for the solar neighbourhood and inversely\nproportional to the GMC density. The observed shallow relation between cluster\nradius and mass gives t_dis a power-law dependence on the mass with index 0.7,\nsimilar to that found from observations and from simulations of clusters\ndissolving in tidal fields (0.62). The constant of 2.0 Gyr is about a factor of\n3.5 shorter than found from earlier simulations of clusters dissolving under\nthe combined effect of galactic tidal field and stellar evolution.

Such solutions are investigated for a diatomic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam\nchain, i. e., a chain of alternate heavy and light masses coupled by anharmonic\nforces. For hard interaction potentials, discrete breathers in this model are\nknown to exist either as ``optic breathers'' with frequencies above the optic\nband, or as ``acoustic breathers'' with frequencies in the gap between the\nacoustic and the optic band. In this paper, bifurcations between different\ntypes of discrete breathers are found numerically, with the mass ratio m and\nthe breather frequency omega as bifurcation parameters. We identify a period\ntripling bifurcation around optic breathers, which leads to new breather\nsolutions with frequencies in the gap, and a second local bifurcation around\nacoustic breathers. These results provide new breather solutions of the FPU\nsystem which interpolate between the classical acoustic and optic modes. The\ntwo bifurcation lines originate from a particular ``corner'' in parameter space\n(omega,m). As parameters lie near this corner, we prove by means of a center\nmanifold reduction that small amplitude solutions can be described by a\nfour-dimensional reversible map.
