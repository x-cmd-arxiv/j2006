In order for a massive star to become a\nWR star, it must shed its H envelope, but new estimates of the effects of\nclumping in winds indicate that line driving is vastly insufficient. We discuss\nmassive stars above roughly 40-50 Msun, for which the best alternative is mass\nloss during brief eruptions of luminous blue variables (LBVs). Our clearest\nexample of this phenomenon is the 19th century outburst of eta Car, when the\nstar shed 12-20 Msun or more in less than a decade. Other examples are\ncircumstellar nebulae of LBVs, extragalactic eta Car analogs (``supernova\nimpostors''), and massive shells around SNe and GRBs. We do not yet fully\nunderstand what triggers LBV outbursts, but they occur nonetheless, and present\na fundamental mystery in stellar astrophysics. Since line opacity from metals\nbecomes too saturated, the extreme mass loss probably arises from a\ncontinuum-driven wind or a hydrodynamic explosion, both of which are\ninsensitive to metallicity. As such, eruptive mass loss could have played a\npivotal role in the evolution and fate of massive metal-poor stars in the early\nuniverse. If they occur in these Population III stars, such eruptions would\nprofoundly affect the chemical yield and types of remnants from early SNe and\nhypernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Jun 2006 20:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

There is a linear empirical relationship between the mid-IR\n24um and hydrogen recombination (extinction-corrected Pa-alpha) luminosity for\nthese LIRGs, and the HII regions in the central part of M51. This relation\nholds over more than four decades in luminosity suggesting that the mid-IR\nemission is a good tracer of the star formation rate (SFR). Analogous to the\nwidely used relation between the SFR and total IR luminosity of Kennicutt\n(1998), we derive an empirical calibration of the SFR in terms of the\nmonochromatic 24um luminosity that can be used for luminous, dusty galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Jun 2006 09:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Their model combines\nFarrell's (1972) elastic spherical earth with a viscous half-space overlain by\nan elastic plate lithosphere.
