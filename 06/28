Here we tackle this issue using\nnew, deep \\chandra and \\xmm observations of the cores of three powerful radio\nloud quasars: 1136--135, 1150+497 (\\chandra), and 0723+679 (\\xmm), in the\nredshift range $z$=0.3--0.8. These sources are known from our previous \\chandra\nsnapshot survey to have kpc-scale X-ray jets. In 1136--135 and 1150+497,\nevidence is found for the presence of diffuse thermal X-ray emission around the\ncores, on scales of 40--50 kpc and with luminosity L$_{0.3-2 keV} \\sim 10^{43}$\n\\lum, suggesting thermal emission from the host galaxy or a galaxy group. The\nX-ray continua of the cores in the three sources are described by an\nupward-curved (concave) broken power law, with photon indices $\\Gamma_{soft}\n\\sim 1.8-2.1$ and $\\Gamma_{hard} \\sim 1.7$ below and above $\\approx 2$ keV,\nrespectively. There is evidence for an unresolved \\feka line with EW $\\sim$ 70\neV in the three quasars. The Spectral Energy Distributions of the sources can\nbe well described by a mix of jet and disk emission, with the jet dominating\nthe radio and hard X-rays (via synchrotron and external Compton) and the disk\ndominating the optical/UV through soft X-rays. The ratio of the jet-to-disk\npowers is $\\sim 1$, consistent with those derived for a number of gamma-ray\nemitting blazars. This indicates that near equality of accretion and jet power\nmay be common in powerful radio-loud AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2006 16:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Quasars show an additional\ndegree of complexity compared to stars that is related to anisotropic\nemission/obscuration influencing the observed properties in most spectral\nranges. This complicating factor has hampered efforts to define the equivalent\nof an Hertzsprung-Russel diagram for quasars. Even if it has recently become\npossible to estimate black hole mass and Eddington ratio for sources using\noptical and UV broad emission lines, the results are still plagued by large\nuncertainties. Nevertheless, robust trends are emerging from multivariate\nanalysis of large spectral datasets of quasars. A firm observational basis is\nbeing laid out by accurate measurements of broad emission line properties\nespecially when the source rest-frame is known. We consider the most widely\ndiscussed correlations (i.e. the so-called \"eigenvector 1 parameter space\" and\nthe \"Baldwin effect\") and analyze how they can be explained in terms of\naccretion properties, broad line region structure, and source evolution. We\ncritically review recent estimates of black hole mass, accretion rate, spin and\npossible orientation indicators, stressing that any improvement in these\nparameters will provide a much better understanding of the physics and dynamics\nof the region producing the optical and UV broad emission lines.

The transition\nhas been characterized by resistivity (rho)versus temperature (T), calorimetry,\nand temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction studies. Measurements of complex\ndielectric permittivity epsilon* (= epsilon'-i.epsilon'') over a low-frequency\nrange (1 Hz - 10 MHz)across T_JT reveal a distinct anomaly. This observation,\nand the reported relatively high static dielectric constant at T = 0 (epsilon0\n\\~18-20), possibly indicate that the orbital order gives rise to intrinsic\npolarization that undergoes transition at T_JT. The frequency dispersion of the\ndielectric response at any given temperature, however, reveals that the\ndielectric response consists of Maxwell-Wagner component, due to interfaces,\nwithin such a low frequency range. The T_JT and the nature of the anomaly in\nepsilon'(omega,T), epsilon''(omega,T) at T_JT, of course, vary - from a sharp\nupward feature to a smeared plateau and then a downward trend - depending on\nthe Mn^4+ concentration of the sample.

An interactions-driven dynamics of\neconomic sentiment is modeled by an Ising model on a large (two-dimensional)\nsquare lattice. The individual states are called optimism and pessimism. The\nexogenous environment is modeled as a sequence of random events, which might\nhave a positive or negative influence on economic sentiment. These exogenous\nevents can be frequent or rare, have a lasting impact or a non-lasting impact.\nImpact of events is inhomogeneous over the lattice, as individuals might fail\nto perceive particular events. We introduce two notions of social herding:\npermanent herding refers to the situation where an ordered state (i.e. a state\nwith an overwhelming majority of optimists or pessimists) persists over an\ninfinite time horizon, while temporary herding refers to the situation where\nordered states appear, persist for some time and decay. The parameter of the\ninter-agent interaction strength is such as to engender permanent herding\nwithout the influence of the environment. To investigate the impact of an\nenvironment we determine whether an initially ordered state decays. We consider\ntwo cases: in the first case positive and negative events have both the same\nempirical frequencies and strengths, while in the second case events have the\nsame empirical frequencies but different strengths. (In the first case the\nenvironment is ``neutral''in the long term), In the neutral case we find\ntemporary herding if events are sufficiently ``strong'' and/or perceived by a\nsufficiently large proportion of agents, and our results suggest that permanent\nherding occurs for small values of the parameters. In the ``non-neutral'' case\nwe find only temporary herding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Jun 2006 17:39:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Dec 2006 14:08:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Feb 2008 12:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-13"}
