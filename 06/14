The photometry is performed using simultaneous deconvolution of the data,\nwhich provides the individual light curves of the otherwise blended quasar\nimages. The time delay is determined from the light curves using two very\ndifferent numerical techniques, i.e., polynomial fitting and direct\ncross-correlation. The time delay is converted into H_0 following analytical\nmodeling of the potential well.\n  Results: Our best estimate of the time delay is Dt = 49.5 +/- 1.9 days, i.e.,\nwe reach a 3.8% accuracy. The R-band flux ratio between the quasar images,\ncorrected for the time delay and for slow microlensing, is F_A /F_B = 6.2 +/-\n5%.\n  Conclusions: The accuracy reached on the time delay allows us to discriminate\nwell between families of lens models.

K-band imaging with the FLAMINGOS\ninstrument on the 4-meter telescope at Kitt Peak for 96 such candidates allows\npreliminary identification of HzRG candidates through the well-known K-z\nrelation.

In this letter we point out that two correction have\nto be made to the samples: 1) radio loud AGNs have to be excluded since their\nX-ray emission might be dominated by the jet component; 2) Compton thick\nsources have to be excluded too since their hard X-ray and soft gamma ray\nemission are also strongly attenuated by Compton scattering. The soft gamma-ray\nselected AGN samples obtained by SWIFT and INTEGRAL provide the best\nopportunity to study the fraction of obscured AGN in the local universe in the\nleast biased way. We choose these samples to check if the corrections could\nalter the above result on the fraction of obscured AGNs. We find that before\nthe corrections both samples show significant anti-correlation between L_X and\nN_H, indicating obvious decrease in the fraction of obscured AGNs with\nluminosity. However, after the corrections, we find only marginal evidence of\nanti-correlation (at 98% confidence level) in the SWIFT sample, and no evidence\nat all in the INTEGRAL sample which consists of comparable number of objects.\nWe conclude that current samples only show a marginal decrease in the fraction\nof obscured AGNs in the local universe, and much larger samples are required to\nreach a more robust conclusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2006 01:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The main motivation for extra\ndimensions relies on the more fundamental string theories that predict ten (or\neleven) space-time dimensions. Extra dimensions must be compactified and there\nappear branes where gauge and/or gravity propagates. Compactification relates\nstring constants (string scale and string coupling) with four-dimensional\nconstants (Planck scale and gauge coupling). Only gravity can propagate in\ndimensions transverse to the brane. They can be detected either by\ngravitational (table-top) or by collider experiments where Kaluza-Klein\ngraviton production appears as missing energy. Transverse dimensions can be as\nlarge as the sub-millimeter. Ordinary matter can also propagate in dimensions\nparallel to the brane. It can give rise to bumps in the dilepton invariant mass\nin hadron colliders or contribute by indirect effects to the electroweak\nobservables. Longitudinal dimensions can be probed at LHC up to a scale of 6.7\nTeV (9 TeV) for one (two) extra dimension(s). Extra dimensions also give rise\nto new theoretical ideas related to supersymmetry and electroweak breaking.\nSome of these ideas are reviewed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2006 17:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This leads to a considerable simplification of the problem\neventually containing only hydrodynamic variables. First, we point out that the\nenergy of any perturbation growing in the presence of magnetic field has to\ngrow faster without the field. This is a paradox because the base flow is\nstable without the magnetic while it is unstable in the presence of a helical\nmagnetic field without being modified by the latter as it has been found\nrecently by Hollerbach and Rudiger [Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 124501 (2005)]. We\nrevisit this problem by using a Chebyshev collocation method to calculate the\neigenvalue spectrum of the linearized problem. In this way, we confirm that MRI\nwith helical magnetic field indeed works in the inductionless limit where the\ndestabilization effect appears as an effective shift of the Rayleigh line.\nSecond, we integrate the linearized equations in time to study the transient\nbehavior of small amplitude perturbations, thus showing that the energy\narguments are correct as well. However, there is no real contradiction between\nboth facts. The linear stability theory predicts the asymptotic development of\nan arbitrary small-amplitude perturbation, while the energy stability theory\nyields the instant growth rate of any particular perturbation, but it does not\naccount for the evolution of this perturbation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2006 13:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

To recover a normal eyeball\npositioning, the most frequent surgical technique consists in the osteotomy of\norbital walls combined with the manual loading on the eyeball. Only a rough\nclinical rule is currently available for the surgeons but it is useless for\nthis technique. The first biomechanical model dealing with proptosis reduction,\nvalidated in one patient, has been previously proposed by the authors. METHODS:\nThis paper proposes a rule improving the pre-operative planning of the\nosteotomy size in proptosis reduction. Patient-related poroelastic FE models\ncombined with sensitivity studies were used to propose two clinical rules to\nimprove the pre-operative planning of proptosis reduction. This poroelastic\nmodel was run on 12 patients. Sensitivity studies permitted to establish\nrelationships between the osteotoemy size, the patient-related orbital volume,\nthe decompressed tissue volume and the eyeball backward displacement. FINDINGS:\nThe eyeball displacement and the osteotomy size were non-linearly related: an\nexponential rule has been proposed. The patient-related orbital volume showed a\nsignificant influence: a bi-quadratic analytical equation liking the osteotomy\nsize, the orbital volume and the targeted eyeball protrusion has been\nestablished. INTERPRETATION: Two process rules derived from patient-related\nbiomechanical FE models have been proposed for the proptosis reduction\nplanning. The implementation of the process rules into a clinical setting is\neasy since only a sagittal radiography is required. The osteotomy size can be\nmonitored using optical guided instruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2006 14:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this interferometer, the simple picture of\ntwo-path interference cannot be applied. We introduce a nearby quantum point\ncontact to detect the electron in a quantum dot inserted in the interferometer.\nWe found that charge detection reduces but does not completely suppress the\ninterference even in the limit of perfect detection. We attribute this\nphenomenon to the unique nature of the closed-loop interferometer. That is, the\nclosed-loop interferometer cannot be simply regarded as a two-path\ninterferometer because of multiple reflections of electrons. As a result, there\nexist indistinguishable paths of the electron in the interferometer and the\ninterference survives even in the limit of perfect charge detection. This\nimplies that charge detection is not equivalent to path detection in a\nclosed-loop interferometer. We also discuss the phase rigidity of the\ntransmission probability for a two-terminal conductor in the presence of a\ndetector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2006 07:15:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2006 06:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Indistinguishability is what leads to the effect of\nquantum interference. Optical interferometers such as Michaelson interferometer\nprovide a measure for second-order coherence at one-photon level and\nHong-Ou-Mandel interferometer was widely employed to describe two-photon\nentanglement and indistinguishability. However, there is not an effective way\nfor a system of more than two photons. Recently, a new interferometric scheme\nwas proposed to quantify the degree of multi-photon distinguishability. Here we\nreport an experiment to implement the scheme for three-photon case. We are able\nto generate three photons with different degrees of temporal distinguishability\nand demonstrate how to characterize them by the visibility of three-photon\ninterference. This method of quantitative description of multi-photon\nindistinguishability will have practical implications in the implementation of\nquantum information protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2006 08:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
