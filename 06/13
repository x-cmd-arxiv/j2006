Here, we assess this claim by comparing the cool\ndisc-blackbody model with a range of other models. For example, we show that\nthe same ULX spectra can be fitted equally well by subtracting a disc-blackbody\ncomponent from a dominant power-law component, thus turning a soft excess into\na soft deficit. Then, we propose a more complex physical model, based on a\npower-law component slightly modified at various energies by smeared emission\nand absorption lines from highly-ionized, fast-moving gas. We use the\nXMM-Newton/EPIC spectra of two ULXs in Holmberg II and NGC 4559 as examples.\nOur main conclusion is that the presence of a soft excess or a soft deficit\ndepends on the energy range over which we choose to fit the ``true'' power-law\ncontinuum; those small deviations from the power-law spectrum are well modelled\nby disc-blackbody components (either in emission or absorption) simply because\nthey are a versatile fitting tool for most kinds of smooth, broad bumps. Hence,\nwe argue that those components should not be taken as evidence for accretion\ndisc emission, nor used to infer BH masses.

The gas and dust ejected\nduring this phase are a major source in the mass budget of the interstellar\nmedium. Recent studies have pointed towards the importance of variations in the\nmass-loss history of such objects. Aims: By modelling the full line profile of\nlow excitation CO lines emitted in the circumstellar envelope, we can study the\nmass-loss history of AGB stars. Methods: We have developed a non-LTE radiative\ntransfer code, which calculates the velocity structure and gas kinetic\ntemperature of the envelope in a self-consistent way. The resulting structure\nof the envelope provides the input for the molecular line radiative\ncalculations which are evaluated in the comoving frame. The code allows for the\nimplementation of modulations in the mass-loss rate. This code has been\nbenchmarked against other radiative transfer codes and is shown to perform well\nand efficiently. Results: We illustrate the effects of varying mass-loss rates\nin case of a superwind phase. The model is applied to the well-studied case of\nVY CMa. We show that both the observed integrated line strengths as the\nspectral structure present in the observed line profiles, unambiguously\ndemonstrate that this source underwent a phase of high mass loss (~ 3.2E-4\nMsun/yr) some 1000 yr ago.

This problem is cast as a\nmax-min optimization problem with a rank constraint on an appropriately defined\nmatrix variable. The problem is computationally very hard because it is\nnon-convex with respect to both the objective function (output purity) and the\nrank constraint. Despite this difficulty, we provide a tractable computational\nalgorithm that produces the exact optimal solution for codespace of dimension\ntwo. Moreover, this algorithm is easily extended to cover the general class of\ncodespaces, in which case the solution is suboptimal in the sense that the\nsuboptimized output purity serves as a lower bound of the exact optimal purity.\nThe algorithm consists of a sequence of semidefinite programmings and can be\nperformed easily. Two typical quantum error channels are investigated to\nillustrate the effectiveness of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2006 03:45:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2006 09:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Jul 2007 04:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-11-09"}
