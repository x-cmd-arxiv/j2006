The core is well delineated in all three maps. The kinetic\ntemperature in the core, derived from the NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) inversion lines,\nis 12.1+/-0.1 K.

[1] have explored the dynamics of $^4$He\nsuperflow through an array of nanopores. These experiments have found that, as\nthe temperature is lowered, phase-slippage in the pores changes its character,\nfrom synchronous to asynchronous. Inspired by these experiments, we construct a\nmodel to address the characteristics of phase-slippage in superflow through\nnanopore arrays. We focus on the low-temperature regime, in which the\ncurrent-phase relation for a single pore is linear, and thermal fluctuations\nmay be neglected. Our model incorporates two basic ingredients: (1) each pore\nhas its own random value of critical velocity (due, e.g., to atomic-scale\nimperfections), and (2) an effective inter-pore coupling, mediated through the\nbulk superfluid. The inter-pore coupling tends to cause neighbours of a pore\nthat has already phase-slipped also to phase-slip; this process may cascade,\ncreating an avalanche of synchronously slipping phases. As the temperature is\nlowered, the distribution of critical velocities is expected to effectively\nbroaden, owing to the reduction in the superfluid healing length, leading to a\nloss of synchronicity in phase-slippage. Furthermore, we find that competition\nbetween the strength of the disorder in the critical velocities and the\nstrength of the inter-pore interaction leads to a phase transition between\nnon-avalanching and avalanching regimes of phase-slippage.\n  [1] Sato, Y., Hoskinson, E.

The\neldest child of a local militia and political leader, he grew up in war and\nturmoil. His hometown was on the front line during most of the Japanese\ninvasion and occupation of China. When he was 16, Y. S. Chow journeyed, mostly\non foot, to Chongqing (Chung-King), the wartime Chinese capital, to finish his\nhigh school education. When the Communist party gained power in China, Y. S.\nChow had already followed his university job to Taiwan. In Taiwan, he taught\nmathematics as an assistant at National Taiwan University until he came to the\nUnited States in 1954. At the University of Illinois, he studied under J. L.\nDoob and received his Ph.D. in 1958. He served as a staff mathematician and\nadjunct faculty at the IBM Watson Research Laboratory and Columbia University\nfrom 1959 to 1962. He was a member of the Statistics Department at Purdue\nUniversity from 1962 to 1968. From 1968 until his retirement in 1993, Y. S.\nChow served as Professor of Mathematical Statistics at Columbia University. At\ndifferent times, he was a visiting professor at the University of California at\nBerkeley, University of Heidelberg (Germany) and the National Central\nUniversity, Taiwan. He served as Director of the Institute of Mathematics of\nAcademia Sinica, Taiwan, and Director of the Center of Applied Statistics at\nNankai University, Tianjin, China. He was instrumental in establishing the\nInstitute of Statistics of Academia Sinica in Taiwan. He is currently Professor\nEmeritus at Columbia University. Y. S.

He has numerous publications,\nincluding Great Expectations: The Theory of Optimal Stopping (1971), in\ncollaboration with Herbert Robbins and David Siegmund, and Probability Theory\n(1978), in collaboration with Henry Teicher. Y. S. Chow has a strong interest\nin mathematics education. He taught high school mathematics for one year in\n1947 and wrote a book on high school algebra in collaboration with J. H. Teng\nand M. L. Chu. In 1992, Y. S. Chow, together with I. S. Chang and W. C. Ho,\nestablished the Chinese Institute of Probability and Statistics in Taiwan.

Using the exact\nexpansion series of subfilter-scale stresses or integration by parts, the terms\ndescribing the interaction between the mean and fluctuation portions in a\nstatistically steady state are theoretically rewritten into a closed form in\nterms of the known filtered quantities. This process involves high-order\nderivatives with time-independent coefficients. Detailed stability analyses of\nthe closed formulas are presented for determining whether a filtered system is\nnumerically stable when finite difference schemes or others are used to solve\nit. It is shown that by the Gaussian filtering operation, second and higher\neven-order derivatives are derived that always exhibit numerical instability in\na fixed range of directions; hence, if the filter widths are unsuitably large,\nthe filtered Navier-Stokes equations can in certain cases be unconditionally\nunstable even though there is no error in modeling the subfilter-scale stress\nterms.
