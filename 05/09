The survey aims\nto study the kinematics, global structure, substructure, and metallicity of\nM31's halo. Although most of our spectroscopic targets were photometrically\nscreened to reject foreground Milky Way dwarf star contaminants, the latter\nclass of objects still constitutes a substantial fraction of the observed\nspectra in the sparse outer halo. Our likelihood-based method for isolating M31\nred giants uses five criteria: (1) radial velocity, (2) photometry in the\nintermediate-width DDO51 band to measure the strength of the MgH/Mgb absorption\nfeatures, (3) strength of the Na I 8190A absorption line doublet, (4) location\nwithin an (I, V-I) color-magnitude diagram, and (5) comparison of photometric\n(CMD-based) versus spectroscopic (Ca II 8500A triplet-based) metallicity\nestimates. We also discuss K I and TiO diagnostics for giant/dwarf separation\nthat might be useful in future analyses. Training sets consisting of definite\nM31 red giants and Galactic dwarf stars are used to derive empirical\nprobabilitydistribution functions for each diagnostic. These functions are used\nto calculate the likelihood that a given star is a red giant in M31 versus a\nMilky Way dwarf. By applying this diagnostic method to our spectroscopic data\nset, we isolate 40 M31 red giants beyond a projected distance of R = 60 kpc\nfrom the galaxy's center, including three out at R ~ 165 kpc. The ability to\nidentify individual M31 red giants gives us an unprecedented level of\nsensitivity in studying the properties of the galaxy's outer halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2006 17:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2006 07:33:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The rapid\nresponse of Swift shows that the non-thermal X-ray emission transitions\nsmoothly from the prompt phase into a decaying phase whatever the details of\nthe light curve. The decay is often categorized by a steep-to-shallow\ntransition suggesting that the prompt emission and the afterglow are two\ndistinct emission components. In those GRBs with an initially steeply-decaying\nX-ray light curve we are probably seeing off-axis emission due to termination\nof intense central engine activity.

The energy emitted during the late emission\nhump is very likely due to the forward shock being constantly refreshed by\neither late central engine activity or less relativistic material emitted\nduring the prompt phase. In other GRBs the early X-ray emission decays\ngradually following the prompt emission with no evidence for early temporal\nbreaks, and in these bursts the emission may be dominated by classical\nafterglow emission from the external shock as the relativistic jet is slowed by\ninteraction with the surrounding circum-burst medium.

The first definition provides an alternative view of the semantics\nfor logic programming with aggregates described by Pelov et al.\n  The second definition is similar to the traditional answer set definition for\nnormal logic programs, in that, given a logic program with aggregates and an\ninterpretation, the unfolding process produces a positive program.

Inspired by the role of microtubule-transported vesicles, we\nembody the internal dynamics of mass inside a hypha with mutually excluding\nparticles progressing stochastically along a growing one-dimensional lattice.\nThe connection between long range transport of materials for growth, and the\nresulting extension of the hyphal tip has not previously been addressed in the\nmodelling literature. We derive and analyse mean-field equations for the model\nand present a phase diagram of its steady state behaviour, which we compare to\nsimulations.

We focus first on the\nsimplest case of two two-level systems and show that a ``relativistic''\nformulation leads to a complete analysis of the question of separability. Our\napproach is based on Schmidt decomposition of density matrices for a composite\nsystem and non-unitary transformations to a standard form. The positivity of\nthe density matrices is crucial for the method to work. A similar approach\nworks to some extent in higher dimensions, but is a less powerful tool. We\nfurther present a numerical method for examining separability, and illustrate\nthe method by a numerical study of bound entanglement in a composite system of\ntwo three-level systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2006 17:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}

This equivalence class when\nunderstood as defining generalized rays in the Hilbert space is not generally\nconsistent with the superposition principle in interference and polarization\nphenomena. The hidden local gauge symmetry, which arises from the arbitrariness\nof the choice of coordinates in the functional space, is then proposed as a\nbasic gauge symmetry in the non-adiabatic phase. This re-formulation reproduces\nall the successful aspects of the non-adiabatic phase in a manner manifestly\nconsistent with the conventional notion of rays and the superposition\nprinciple. The hidden local symmetry is thus identified as the natural origin\nof the gauge symmetry in both of the adiabatic and non-adiabatic phases in the\nabsence of gauge fields, and it allows a unified treatment of all the geometric\nphases. The non-adiabatic phase may well be regarded as a special case of the\nadiabatic phase in this re-formulation, contrary to the customary understanding\nof the adiabatic phase as a special case of the non-adiabatic phase. Some\nexplicit examples of geometric phases are discussed to illustrate this\nre-formulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2006 07:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2006 08:06:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2006 06:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
