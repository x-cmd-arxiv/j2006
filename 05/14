Also, we calculate the contributions to the vector meson yield due\nto production of vector mesons off nuclear target by photons emitted by proton.\nWe find, that least in the case of Upsilon production it is feasible to observe\nsimultaneously both these processes. Such measurements would increase the\nprecision with which the A-dependence of exclusive onium production can be\ndetermined. This would also enable one to estimate the amount of nuclear gluon\nshadowing of generalized gluon distributions at much smaller x than that is\npossible in AA collisions and to measure the cross sections for photoproduction\nprocesses in a significantly wider energy range than that achieved in\nexperiments with fixed nuclear targets. We also present the cross section for\nvector meson production in pA collisions at RHIC. In addition, we consider\nproduction of vector mesons off protons with large rapidity gaps and large t.\nThese processes probe small x dynamics of the elastic interaction of small\ndipoles at high energies and large but finite t, that is in the kinematics\nwhere DGLAP evolution is strongly suppressed. We estimate that this process\ncould be studied at LHC up to W ~1 TeV with detectors which will be available\nat LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2006 01:23:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 May 2006 09:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In math.AG/0206158 we gave necessary and\nsufficient conditions in terms of Picard lattice of $X$ when $Y$ is isomorphic\nto $X$. The proof of sufficient condition in math.AG/0206158, when $Y$ is\nisomorphic to $X$, used Global Torelli Theorem for K3 surfaces, and it was not\neffective.\n  Here we give an effective variant of these results: its sufficient part gives\nan explicit isomorphism between $Y$ and $X$.\n  We hope that our similar results in math.AG/0304415, math.AG/0307355,\nmath.AG/0309348 for arbitrary primitive isotropic Mukai vector on a K3 surface\nalso can be made effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2006 09:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-22"}

Whitehead's work on simple homotopy types. From the Colimit\nTheorem for the Fundamental Crossed Complex of a CW-complex (due to R. Brown\nand P.J.

This expands an old result (due to J.H.C.\nWhitehead) asserting that the homotopy type of $\\Pi(M)$ depends only on the\nhomotopy type of $M$. We use these results to define a homotopy invariant $I_A$\nof CW-complexes for any finite crossed complex $A$. We interpret it in terms of\nthe weak homotopy type of the function space $TOP((M,*),(|A|,*))$, where $|A|$\nis the classifying space of the crossed complex $A$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 May 2006 12:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-05-23"}
