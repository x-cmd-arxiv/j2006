We construct models in terms of the dimensionless second and\nthird derivatives of the scale factor a(t) with respect to cosmic time t,\nnamely the present-day value of the deceleration parameter q_0 and the cosmic\njerk parameter, j(t). An elegant feature of this parameterization is that all\nLCDM models have j(t)=1 (constant), which facilitates simple tests for\ndepartures from the LCDM paradigm. Applying our model to the three best\navailable sets of redshift-independent distance measurements, from type Ia\nsupernovae and X-ray cluster gas mass fraction measurements, we obtain clear\nstatistical evidence for a late time transition from a decelerating to an\naccelerating phase. For a flat model with constant jerk, j(t)=j, we measure\nq_0=-0.81+-0.14 and j=2.16+0.81-0.75, results that are consistent with LCDM at\nabout the 1sigma confidence level. A standard `dynamical' analysis of the same\ndata, employing the Friedmann equations and modeling the dark energy as a fluid\nwith an equation of state parameter, w (constant), gives\nOmega_m=0.306+0.042-0.040 and w=-1.15+0.14-0.18, also consistent with LCDM at\nabout the 1sigma level. In comparison to dynamical analyses, the kinematical\napproach uses a different model set and employs a minimum of prior information,\nbeing independent of any particular gravity theory. The results obtained with\nthis new approach therefore provide important additional information and we\nargue that both kinematical and dynamical techniques should be employed in\nfuture dark energy studies, where possible. Our results provide further\ninteresting support for the concordance LCDM paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2006 08:31:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 2007 01:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We\nfound that in the mass range of about 1.7-2.2 Msun, indeed this can happen.\n  The main new insight we believe we gained is the crucial importance of an\n\"early\" off-center ignition of carbon, which at a later stage prevents the\ncarbon which forms below the helium burning shell and ignites, from burning the\ncarbon all the way to the center. When helium is almost depleted in the\nconvective envelope by the helium burning shell at its bottom, the now\nsuper-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen core contracts, and the residual\ndegenerate carbon at the center is ignited, resulting in a runaway similar to\nthe classical SN I scenario.\n  Since the structure and behavior of the carbon-oxygen core of the helium\nstars of our interest is very similar to that of a mass accreting carbon-oxygen\nstar, we also thoroughly examined the behavior of carbon-oxygen stars.

The disorder-unrelated\npolarization is associated with all electron states below the Fermi surface and\nproduces the original intrinsic spin-Hall current, while the disorder-mediated\npolarization emerges with contribution from the electron states near the Fermi\nsurface and gives rise to an additional contribution to the spin-Hall current.\nWithin the diffusive regime, the total spin-Hall conductivity vanishes in {\\it\ninfinitely large} samples, independently of temperature, of the spin-orbit\ncoupling constant, of the impurity density, and of the specific form of the\nelectron-impurity scattering potential.

Thereby we resolve\nthe longstanding controversy concerning the role played by the kinetic energy\nin stripe phases. While the transverse hopping across the domain walls yields\nthe largest kinetic energy gain in the case of the insulating stripes with one\nhole per site, the holes propagating along the domain walls stabilize the\nmetallic vertical stripes with one hole per two sites, as observed in the\ncuprates. We also show that a finite next-nearest neighbor hopping $t'$ can tip\nthe energy balance between the filled diagonal and half-filled vertical\nstripes, which might explain a change in the spatial orientation of stripes\nobserved in the high $T_c$ cuprates at the doping $x\\simeq 1/16$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2006 12:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The effect of vaccine therapy is\nconsidered as a parametric perturbation of the model. In the case of a weak\nimmune response, neither immunotherapy nor chemotherapy is found to cause tumor\nregression to a small size, which would be below the clinically detectable\nthreshold. Numerical simulations show that the efficiency of vaccine therapy\ndepends on both the tumor size and the condition of immune system as well as on\nthe response of the organism to vaccination. In particular, we found that\nvaccine therapy becomes more effective when used without time delay from a\nprescribed date of vaccination after surgery and is ineffective without\npreliminary treatment. For a strong immune response, our model predicts the\ntumor remission under vaccine therapy. Our study of successive chemo/immuno,\nimmuno/chemo and concurrent chemoimmunotherapy shows that the chemo/immuno\nsequence is more effective while concurrent chemoimmunotherapy is more sparing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2006 06:53:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jul 2007 18:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Oct 2008 08:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-15"}
