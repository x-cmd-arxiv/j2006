Among many proposals to describe this\nphenomenon, the cosmological constant seems to be the simplest and the most\nnatural explanation. However, despite its observational successes, such a\npossibility exacerbates the well known cosmological constant problem, requiring\na natural explanation for its small, but nonzero, value. In this paper we\nconsider a cosmological scenario driven by a varying cosmological term, in\nwhich the vacuum energy density decays linearly with the Hubble parameter. We\nshow that this model is indistinguishable from the standard one in that the\nearly radiation phase is followed by a long dust-dominated era, and only\nrecently the varying cosmological term becomes dominant, accelerating the\ncosmic expansion. In order to test the viability of this scenario we have used\nthe most recent type Ia supernova data, i.e., the High-Z SN Search (HZS) Team\nand the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS) Collaboration data. In particular, for\nthe SNLS sample we have found the present matter density and Hubble parameters\nin the intervals [0.27, 0.37] and [0.68, 0.72], respectively (at 95% c.l.),\nwhich is in good agreement with the currently accepted estimates for these\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2006 19:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2006 16:13:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-19"}

The presence\nof icy comets surrounding the star or catalysis on iron grain surfaces have\nbeen invoked to explain the presence of such unexpected species. This detailed\nstudy aims at evaluating the chances of producing O-bearing species in the\nC-rich circumstellar envelope only by gas phase chemical reactions.

Human design\nactivities are surveyed, and popular computer-aided design methodologies are\nexamined. It is argued that semiotics has the potential to merge and unite\nvarious design approaches into one fundamental theory that is naturally\ninterpretable and so comprehensible in terms of computer use. Reviewing related\nwork in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science provides a general and\nencompassing vision of the creativity phenomenon. Basic notions of algebraic\nsemiotics are given and explained in terms of design. This is to define a model\nof the design creative process, which is seen as a process of semiosis, where\nconcepts and their attributes represented as signs organized into systems are\nevolved, blended, and analyzed, resulting in the development of new concepts.\nThe model allows us to formally describe and investigate essential properties\nof the design process, namely its dynamics and non-determinism inherent in\ncreative thinking. A stable pattern of creative thought - analogical and\nmetaphorical reasoning - is specified to demonstrate the expressive power of\nthe modeling approach; illustrative examples are given. The developed theory is\napplied to clarify the nature of emergence in design: it is shown that while\nemergent properties of a product may influence its creative value, emergence\ncan simply be seen as a by-product of the creative process. Concluding remarks\nsummarize the research, point to some unresolved issues, and outline directions\nfor future work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2006 11:35:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The latters are discrete subgroups of the group of conformal\nautomorphisms of the Riemann sphere. This dictionary motivated many remarkable\nresults in both domains, starting from the famous Sullivan's no wandering\ndomain theorem in the theory of iterations of rational functions.\n  One of the principal objects used in the study of Kleinian groups is the\nhyperbolic 3- manifold associated to a Kleinian group, which is the quotient of\nits lifted action to the hyperbolic 3- space. M.Lyubich and Y.Minsky have\nsuggested to extend Sullivan's dictionary by providing an analogous\nconstruction for iterations of rational functions. Namely, they have\nconstructed a lamination by three-dimensional manifolds equipped with a\ncontinuous family with hyperbolic metrics on them (may be with singularities).\nThe action of the rational mapping on the sphere lifts naturally up to\nhomeomorphic action on the hyperbolic lamination that is isometric along the\nleaves. The action on the hyperbolic lamination admits a well-defined quotient\ncalled {\\it the quotient hyperbolic lamination}.\n  We study the arrangement of the horospheres in the quotient hyperbolic\nlamination. The main result says that if a rational function does not belong to\na small list of exceptions (powers, Chebyshev and Latt\\`es), then there are\nmany dense horospheres, i.e., the horospheric lamination is\ntopologically-transitive. We show that for \"many\" rational functions\n(hyperbolic or critically-nonrecurrent nonparabolic) the quotient horospheric\nlamination is minimal: each horosphere is dense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2006 17:59:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Nov 2006 12:20:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2010 12:47:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-11"}

For any such representation we define the Toledo invariant, for which we\nestablish properties such as uniform boundedness on the representation variety,\nadditivity under connected sum of surfaces and congruence relations. We thus\nobtain geometric properties of the maximalrepresentations, that is\nrepresentations whose Toledo invariant achieves the maximum value: we show that\nmaximal representations have discrete image, are faithful and completely\nreducible and they always preserve a maximal tube type subdomain. This extends\nto the case of a general Hermitian group some of the properties of the\nrepresentations in Teichmuller space, as well as results due to Goldman,\nToledo, Hernandez, Bradlow--Garcia-Prada--Gothen. An announcement of these\nresults in the case of surfaces without boundary -- where the role of tube type\ndomains had already been emphasized -- appeared in 2003 by the same authors.\n  The congruence relations for the Toledo invariant involve a rotation number\nfunction related to a continuous homogeneous quasimorphism which gives an\nexplicit way to compute the Toledo invariant. This rotation number generalizes\nconstructions due to Ghys, Barge--Ghys, and Clerc--Koufany.\n  We establish moreover properties of boundary maps associated to maximal\nrepresentations which generalize naturally, for the causal structure of the\nShilov boundary, monotonicity properties of quasiconjugations of the circle.\nThis, together with the congruence relations leads to the result that the\nsubset of maximal representations is always real semialgebraic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2006 23:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2006 10:03:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Sep 2008 11:41:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-09-15"}

Our theory\nquantitatively describes how neutral evolution leads to marginally stable\nproteins, and provides formulae for calculating how fluctuations in stability\ncause an overdispersion of the molecular clock.

The exploitation of such\npower definitely requires a deep understanding of the mechanism of quantum loop\nprograms. In this paper, we introduce a general scheme of quantum loops and\ndescribe its computational process. The notions of termination and almost\ntermination are proposed for quantum loops, and the function computed by a\nquantum loop is defined. To show their expressive power, quantum loops are\napplied in describing quantum walks. Necessary and sufficient conditions for\ntermination and almost termination of a general quantum loop on any mixed input\nstate are presented. A quantum loop is said to be (almost) terminating if it\n(almost) terminates on any input state. We show that a quantum loop is almost\nterminating if and only if it is uniformly almost terminating. It is observed\nthat a small disturbance either on the unitary transformation in the loop body\nor on the measurement in the loop guard can make any quantum loop (almost)\nterminating. Moreover, a representation of the function computed by a quantum\nloop is given in terms of finite summations of matrices. To illustrate the\nnotions and results obtained in this paper, two simplest classes of quantum\nloop programs, one qubit quantum loops, and two qubit quantum loops defined by\ncontrolled gates, are carefully examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 May 2006 14:05:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 2007 14:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-04-02"}
