Here it is argued that the oxic transition,\nwhich took place between approximately 2.3 and 0.5 Gyr ago, required a great\nproliferation of cyanobacteria, and this in turn depended on their ability to\nfix nitrogen via the nitrogenase enzyme system. However, the ability to fix\nnitrogen was not a panacea, and the rate of biospheric oxygenation may still\nhave been affected by nitrogen constraints on cyanobacterial expansion.\nEvidence is presented for why cyanobacteria probably have a great need for\nfixed nitrogen than other prokaryotes, underscoring the importance of their\nability to fix nitrogen. The connection between nitrogen fixation and the\nevolution of photosynthesis is demonstrated by the similarities between\nnitrogenase and enzymes critical for the biosynthesis of (bacterio)chlorophyll.\nIt is hypothesized that biospheric oxygenation would not have occurred if the\nemergence of cyanobacteria had not been preceded by the evolution of nitrogen\nfixation, and if these organisms had not also acquired the ability to fix\nnitrogen at the beginning of or very early in their history. The evolution of\nnitrogen fixation also appears to have been a precondition for the evolution of\n(bacterio)chlorophyll-based photosynthesis.

It will be discussed how the\nsound mode interferes with other low-lying modes present in the system.\nThereby, we provide a systematic explanation of the anomalous sound-velocity\ndispersion in systems -- ranging from high temperature liquid down to deep\ninside the glass state -- in terms of the contributions from the\nstructural-relaxation processes and from vibrational excitations called the\nanomalous-oscillation peak (AOP).

As a consequence of the presence of the AOP in the transversal current\nspectra, it is predicted that the transversal sound velocity also exhibits the\nanomalous dispersion.

Our framework\nincorporates four major components. (i) The recently established existence of\nspace-time order at all scales (fundamental structure) observed directly in\ntypical configurations of regularized path-integral ensembles. (ii) The notion\nof scale-dependent vacuum structure (effective structure) providing the means\nfor representing and quantifying the influence of fluctuations at various\nscales on physical observables (phenomena). (iii) The unified description of\ngauge and fermionic aspects of the theory which facilitates a high level of\nspace-time order in the path-integral ensembles. (iv) The strict ``Bottom-Up''\napproach wherein the process of identifying the vacuum structure proceeds\ninductively, using the information from valid lattice QCD ensembles as the only\ninput. In this work we first elaborate on the meaning of the notion of\nspace-time order in a given configuration which is conceptually at the heart of\nthe path-integral approach to vacuum structure. It is argued that the\nalgorithmic complexity of binary strings associated with coarse-grained\ndescriptions of the configuration provides a relevant quantitative measure. The\ncorresponding ensemble averages define the ranking of different lattice\ntheories at given cutoff by the degree of space-time order generated via their\ndynamics. We then introduce the set of local transformations of a\nconfiguration, chiral orderings, in which the transformed gauge connection\nrepresents an effective matrix phase acquired by chiral fermion when hopping\nover a given link. It is proposed that chiral orderings facilitate the\nevolution in the set of actions which increases the degree of space-time order\nwhile preserving the physical content of the theory, and should thus be used in\nthe search for the fundamental QCD vacuum structure. The relation to\nrenormalization group ideas is discussed, and the first step in general\nformulation of effective lattice QCD realizing the notion of scale-dependent\nvacuum structure is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2006 18:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 May 2006 19:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We find that the interference between the\nexponential and nonexponential terms of the survival amplitude modifies the\nusual exponential decay regime in systems where the ratio of the resonance\nenergy to the decay width, is less than 0.3. We suggest that such regime could\nbe observed in semiconductor double-barrier resonant quantum structures with\nappropriate parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 May 2006 11:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-01"}
