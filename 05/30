Methods - We obtained\nlow-resolution spectroscopy (lambda/Dlambda~800-1300) for 133 targets,\nincluding 76 yet-to-confirm candidate clusters (i.e. with no previous\nspectroscopic information), 55 already-confirmed genuine M31 clusters, and 2\nuncertain candidates. Our observations allowed a reliable estimate of the\ntarget radial velocity, within a typical accuracy of ~+-20km/s. The observed\ncandidates have been robustly classified according to their radial velocity and\nshape parameters that allowed us to confidently discriminate between point\nsources and extended objects even from low-spatial-resolution imagery. Results\n- In our set of 76 candidates clusters we found: 42 newly-confirmed bona-fide\nM~31 clusters, 12 background galaxies, 17 foreground Galactic stars, 2 HII\nregions belonging to M31 and 3 unclassified (possibly M31 clusters or\nforeground stars) objects. The classification of a few other candidates not\nincluded in our survey has been also reassessed on various observational bases.\nAll the sources of radial velocity estimates for M31 known globular clusters\navailable in the literature have been compared and checked, and a homogeneous\ngeneral list has been obtained for 349 confirmed clusters with radial velocity.\nConclusions - Our results suggest that a significant number of genuine clusters\n(~> 100) is still hidden among the plethora of known candidates proposed by\nvarious authors. Hence our knowledge of the globular cluster system of the M31\ngalaxy is still far from complete even in terms of simple membership.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2006 14:34:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In particular, we\ninvestigate the scaling relations between mass, luminosity and temperature of\ngalaxy groups and clusters in the absence of radiative processes. Theoretical\nexpectations are derived from a polytropic model of the intracluster medium and\ncompared with the results of high-resolution adiabatic gasdynamical\nsimulations. It is shown that, in addition to the well-known relation between\nthe mass and concentration of the dark matter halo, the effective polytropic\nindex of the gas also varies systematically with cluster mass, and therefore\nneither the dark matter nor the gas profiles are exactly self-similar. It is\nremarkable, though, that the effects of concentration and polytropic index tend\nto cancel each other, leading to scaling relations whose logarithmic slopes\nroughly match the predictions of the most basic self-similar models. We provide\na phenomenological fit to the relation between polytropic index and\nconcentration, as well as a self-consistent scheme to derive the non-linear\nscaling relations expected for any cosmology and the best-fit normalizations of\nthe M-T, L-T and F-T relations appropriate for a Lambda-CDM universe.

Here we embed this idea into an\norientifold setup as suggested in arXiv:hep-th/0511099. The non-Kaehler\nbackgrounds we obtain in type IIA are non-trivially fibered due to their\nconstruction from IIB via T-duality with Neveu-Schwarz flux. We demonstrate\nthat these non-Kaehler manifolds are not half-flat and show that a symplectic\nstructure exists on them at least locally.\n  We also review the construction of new non-Kaehler backgrounds in type I and\nheterotic theory as proposed in arXiv:hep-th/0408192. They are found by a\nseries of T- and S-duality and can be argued to be related by geometric\ntransitions as well. A local toy model is provided that fulfills the flux\nequations of motion in IIB and the torsional relation in heterotic theory, and\nthat is consistent with the U-duality relating both theories. For the heterotic\ntheory we also propose a global solution that fulfills the torsional relation\nbecause it is similar to the Maldacena-Nunez background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2006 23:12:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Dec 2006 16:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

For Lagrangian systems, our method provide a fractional\nEuler-Lagrange equation.

We then obtain naturally a fractional Noether theorem\nand a fractional Hamiltonian formulation of fractional Lagrangian systems. All\nthese constructions are coherents, i.e. that the embedding procedure is\ncompatible with the fractional calculus of variations. We then extend our\nresults to cover the Ostrogradski formalism. Using the fractional embedding and\nfollowing a previous work of F.

We consider\ntwo models: In the first model, we consider the flow of some resource into a\ncompartment, and the conversion of this resource into some product. In the\nsecond model, we consider the resource-limited growth of autoreplicating\nsystems. In this case, we divide the replication and metabolic tasks among\ndifferent agents. The general features that emerge from our models is that\ndivision of labor is favored when the resource to agent ratio is at\nintermediate values, and when the time cost associated with transporting\nintermediate products is small compared to characteristic process times. We\ndiscuss the results of this paper in the context of simulations with digital\nlife. We also argue that division of labor in the context of our replication\nmodel suggests an evolutionary basis for the emergence of the stem-cell-based\ntissue architecture in complex organisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2006 22:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A central question is which structural\ninformation Phi-values contain about the transition state of folding.\nTraditionally, a Phi-value is interpreted as the 'nativeness' of a mutated\nresidue in the transition state. However, this interpretation is often\nproblematic because it assumes a linear relation between the nativeness of the\nresidue and its free-energy contribution. We present here a better structural\ninterpretation of Phi-values for mutations within a given helix. Our\ninterpretation is based on a simple physical model that distinguishes between\nsecondary and tertiary free-energy contributions of helical residues. From a\nlinear fit of our model to the experimental data, we obtain two structural\nparameters: the extent of helix formation in the transition state, and the\nnativeness of tertiary interactions in the transition state. We apply our model\nto all proteins with well-characterized helices for which more than 10\nPhi-values are available: protein A, CI2, and protein L. The model captures\nnonclassical Phi-values <0 or >1 in these helices, and explains how different\nmutations at a given site can lead to different Phi-values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2006 10:04:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For this purpose, we incorporate redundancy\nby mapping a given initial quantum state to a messenger state on a\nlarger-dimensional Hilbert space via a $C^*$-algebra embedding. Our noise model\nfor the transmission is a phase damping channel which admits a noiseless or\ndecoherence-free subspace or subsystem. More precisely, the transmission\nchannel is obtained from convex combinations of a set of lowest rank yes/no\nmeasurements that leave a component of the messenger state unchanged. The\nobjective of our encoding is to distribute quantum information optimally across\nthe noise-susceptible component of the transmission when the noiseless\ncomponent is not large enough to contain all the quantum information to be\ntransmitted. We derive simple geometric conditions for optimal encoding and\nconstruct examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 May 2006 18:34:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
