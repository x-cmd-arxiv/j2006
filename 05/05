We analyse the time-dependent dynamics of a\nnon-coorbital corotation resonance under these circumstances. The ratio of the\nresonant torque in a steady state to the value given by Goldreich & Tremaine\n(1979) depends essentially on two dimensionless quantities: a dimensionless\nturbulent diffusion time-scale and a dimensionless radial drift speed. When the\ndrift speed is comparable to the libration speed and the viscosity is small,\nthe torque can become much larger than the unsaturated value in the absence of\nmigration, but is still proportional to the large-scale vortensity gradient in\nthe disc. Fluid that is trapped in the resonance and drifts with it acquires a\nvortensity anomaly relative to its surroundings. If the anomaly is limited by\nviscous diffusion in a steady state, the resulting torque is inversely\nproportional to the viscosity, although a long time may be required to achieve\nthis state. A further, viscosity-independent, contribution to the torque comes\nfrom fluid that streams through the resonant region.

We show that with realistic Toomre\nQ values, self-gravity and galactic differential rotation produce filamentary\ngaseous structures with kpc-scale separations, regardless of the strength -- or\neven presence -- of a stellar spiral potential. However, the growth of sheared\nfeatures distinctly associated with the spiral arms, described as spurs or\nfeathers in optical and IR observations of many spiral galaxies, requires a\nsufficiently strong spiral potential in self gravitating models. Unlike\nindependently-growing ''background'' filaments, the orientation of arm spurs\ndepends on galactic location. Inside corotation, spurs emanate outward, on the\nconvex side of the arm; outside corotation, spurs grow inward, on the concave\nside of the arm. Based on spacing, orientation, and the relation to arm clumps,\nit is possible to distinguish ''true spurs'' that originate as instabilities in\nthe spiral arms from independently growing ''background'' filaments. Our models\nalso suggest that magnetic fields are important in preserving grand design\nspiral structure when gas in the arms fragments via self-gravity into GMCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2006 23:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

In contrast\nto the collisionless case equal-mass mergers with gas do not result in very\nboxy remnants which is caused by the suppression of box orbits and the change\nof the projected shape of minor-axis tube orbits in the more axisymmetric\nremnants. The isophotal shape of 3:1 remnants and the global kinematic\nproperties of 1:1 and 3:1 remnants are only weakly affected by the presence of\ngas. 1:1 remnants are slowly rotating whereas 3:1 remnants are fast rotating\nand discy. The shape of the stellar LOSVD is strongly influenced by gas. The\nLOSVDs of collisionless remnants have broad leading wings while their gaseous\ncounterparts show steep leading wings, more consistent with observations of\nelliptical galaxies. We show that this change is also caused by the suppressed\npopulating of box orbits and it is amplified by the formation of extended gas\ndiscs in the merger remnants. If elliptical galaxies have formed from mergers\nour results indicate that massive, slowly rotating boxy elliptical galaxies can\nnot have formed from dissipative mergers of discs. Pure stellar (dry) mergers\nare the more likely candidates. On the other hand lower mass, fast rotating and\ndiscy ellipticals can have formed from dissipative (wet) mergers of early-type\ndiscs.

In the first channel, the Partially\nCooperative Relay Broadcast Channel, only one user in the system can act as a\nrelay and transmit to the other user through a relay link. An achievable rate\nregion is derived based on the relay using the decode-and-forward scheme. An\nouter bound on the capacity region is derived and is shown to be tighter than\nthe cut-set bound. For the special case where the Partially Cooperative RBC is\ndegraded, the achievable rate region is shown to be tight and provides the\ncapacity region. Gaussian Partially Cooperative RBCs and Partially Cooperative\nRBCs with feedback are further studied. In the second channel model being\nstudied in the paper, the Fully Cooperative Relay Broadcast Channel, both users\ncan act as relay nodes and transmit to each other through relay links. This is\na more general model than the Partially Cooperative RBC. All the results for\nPartially Cooperative RBCs are correspondingly generalized to the Fully\nCooperative RBCs. It is further shown that the AWGN Fully Cooperative RBC has a\nlarger achievable rate region than the AWGN Partially Cooperative RBC. The\nresults illustrate that relaying and user cooperation are powerful techniques\nin improving the capacity of broadcast channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2006 19:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}
