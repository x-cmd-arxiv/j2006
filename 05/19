The\nusual collective coordinate method for non-topological scalar solitons is\napplied to quantize the half and quarter BPS R-balls. In each case, a different\nquantization method is also applied to confirm the results from the collective\ncoordinate quantization. For finite N, the half BPS R-balls with a U(1)\nR-charge have a moduli space which, upon quantization, results in the states of\na quantum Hall droplet with filling factor one.

This theory suggests that age-related random damage primarily\naffects the overwhelming majority of the low affinity, transient interactions\n(weak links) in cellular networks leading to increased noise, destabilization\nand diversity. These processes may be further amplified by age-specific network\nremodelling and by the sequestration of weakly linked cellular proteins to\nprotein aggregates of aging cells. Chaperones are weakly linked hubs [i.e.,\nnetwork elements with a large number of connections] and inter-modular bridge\nelements of protein-protein interaction, signalling and mitochondrial networks.\nAs aging proceeds, the increased overload of damaged proteins is an especially\nimportant element contributing to cellular disintegration and destabilization.\nAdditionally, chaperone overload may contribute to the increase of \"noise\" in\naging cells, which leads to an increased stochastic resonance resulting in a\ndeficient discrimination between signals and noise. Chaperone- and other\nmulti-target therapies, which restore the missing weak links in aging cellular\nnetworks, may emerge as important anti-aging interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2006 19:16:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Dec 2006 08:13:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
