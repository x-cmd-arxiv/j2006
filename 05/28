We establish the structure of conjugacy\nclasses for regular epigroups (i.e. semigroups such that some power of each\nelement lies in a subgroup). As a corollary we obtain a criterion of conjugacy\nin terms of $G$-conjugacy for factorizable inverse epigroups. We show that our\ngeneral conjugacy criteria easily lead to known and new conjugacy criteria for\nsome specific semigroups, among which are the full transformation semigroup and\nthe full inverse symmetric semigroup over a finite set, the linear analogues of\nthese semigroups and the semigroup of finitary partial automatic\ntransformations over a finite alphabet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 May 2006 17:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Solutions F can distinguish different orientations of the same matroid.\nA ported extensor with ground set is a decomposible element in the exterior\nalgebra over a vector space with a given basis, called the ground set,\ncontaining a distinguished subset called ports. These can represent ported\nmatroids and have analogous dualization, deletion and contraction operations. A\nported extensor function is defined using dualization, port element renaming,\nexterior multiplication, and contraction of non-ports. We prove that this\nfunction satisfies a sign-corrected variant of the Tutte equations over\nexterior algebra. For non-ported unimodular, i.e., regular matroids, our\nfunction reduces to the basis generating function and for graphs the Laplacian\n(or Kirchhoff) determinant. In general, the function value, as an extensor,\nsignifies the space of solutions to Kirchhoff's and Ohm's electricity equations\nafter projection to the variables associated to the ports. Combinatorial\ninterpretation of various determinants (the Plucker coordinates) generalize the\nmatrix tree theorem and forest enumeration expressions for electrical\nresistance. The corank-nullity polynomial, basis expansions with activities,\nand a geometric lattice expansion generalize to ported Tutte functions of\noriented matroids.
