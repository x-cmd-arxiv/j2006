We identify 15\nstrong MgII absorbers along 14 GRB sightlines (nearly every sightline exhibits\nat least one absorber) with spectra covering a total pathlength Delta z = 15.5\nat a mean redshift <z> = 1.1. In contrast, the predicted incidence of such\nabsorber systems along the same path length to quasar sightlines is only 3.8.\nThe roughly four times higher incidence along GRB sightlines is inconsistent\nwith a statistical fluctuation at greater than 99.9% c.l. Several effects could\nexplain the result: (i) dust within the MgII absorbers obscures faint quasars\ngiving a lower observed incidence along quasar sightlines; (ii) the gas is\nintrinsic to the GRB event; (iii) the GRB are gravitationally lensed by these\nabsorbers. We present strong arguments against the first two effects and also\nconsider lensing to be an unlikely explanation. The results suggest that at\nleast one of our fundamental beliefs on absorption line research is flawed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 May 2006 20:40:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2006 21:01:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

For a strong local nonlinearity, it is\nshown that the creation of v quanta on one site excites a soliton band formed\nby bound states involving v quanta trapped on the same site. The energy is\nfirst localized on the excited site over a significant timescale and then\nslowly delocalizes along the lattice.

However, it is shown that when the nonlocal nonlinearity\nreaches a critical value, the lattice suddenly supports a very fast energy\npropagation whose dynamics is almost independent on the number of quanta.

When coupling is strong enough to prevail over decoherence, it\ncan be used for the engineering of correlated quantum states. Especially for\nsolid-state systems, control of quantum correlations has attracted widespread\nattention because of applications in quantum computing. Such coherent coupling\nhas been demonstrated in a variety of systems at low temperature1, 2. Of all\nquantum systems, spins are potentially the most important, because they offer\nvery long phase memories, sometimes even at room temperature. Although precise\ncontrol of spins is well established in conventional magnetic resonance3, 4,\nexisting techniques usually do not allow the readout of single spins because of\nlimited sensitivity. In this paper, we explore dipolar magnetic coupling\nbetween two single defects in diamond (nitrogen-vacancy and nitrogen) using\noptical readout of the single nitrogen-vacancy spin states. Long phase memory\ncombined with a defect separation of a few lattice spacings allow us to explore\nthe strong magnetic coupling regime. As the two-defect system was well-isolated\nfrom other defects, the long phase memory times of the single spins was not\ndiminished, despite the fact that dipolar interactions are usually seen as\nundesirable sources of decoherence. A coherent superposition of spin pair\nquantum states was achieved. The dipolar coupling was used to transfer spin\npolarisation from a nitrogen-vacancy centre spin to a nitrogen spin, with\noptical pumping of a nitrogen-vacancy centre leading to efficient\ninitialisation. At the level anticrossing efficient nuclear spin polarisation\nwas achieved.
