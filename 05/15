It is argued that\nbright extragalactic planetary nebulae from galaxies (or subsystems) with and\nwithout star formation have different distributions of central star temperature\nand ionization structure. As regards the chemical compositions, oxygen and neon\nare generally found to be unchanged as a result of the evolution of the stellar\nprogenitors. Nitrogen enrichment may occur as a result of the evolution of the\nprogenitors of bright planetary nebulae in all stellar populations, though this\nenrichment may be (more) random in old stellar populations. Helium abundances\nappear to be influenced by the chemical evolution of the host galaxy, with\nplanetary nebulae in dwarf spheroidals having systematically elevated\nabundances. Neither the age nor the metallicity of the progenitor stellar\npopulation has a strong effect upon the kinematics observed for nebular shells.\nBoth the range of expansion velocites, 8-28 km/s, and the typical expansion\nvelocity, ~18 km/s, are found to be relatively constant in all galaxies.

There is increasing evidence that objects with masses of dwarf galaxies\nform in the tidal tails of colliding galaxies and speculations that they could\nbecome satellite-like galaxies around their progenitors and thus be\ncosmologically important. Yet, whether these \"Tidal Dwarf Galaxies\" (TDGs)\ncandidates are really long-lived and not only present in young interacting\nsystems is still an open question to which numerical simulations may give\nanswers. We present a set of 96 simulations of colliding galaxies with various\nmass ratios and encounter geometries, and statistically study the evolution of\ntheir TDG candidates. Among the 593 substructures initially identified in tidal\ntails, about 75% fall back onto their progenitor or are disrupted in a few 10^8\nyears. The remaining 25% become long-lived bound objects that typically survive\nmore than 2Gyr with masses above 10^8 M_sun. These long-lived, satellite-like\nobjects, are found to form in the outer most regions of the tidal tails. We\ninfer several basic properties that dwarf galaxies should meet to have a tidal\norigin and apply these criteria to the Local Group dwarfs. We also find that\nthe presence of TDGs would foster the anisotropy observed in the distribution\nof satellite galaxies around their host. Identifying the conditions required\nfor interacting systems to form long-lived tidal dwarfs, we roughly estimate\ntheir contribution to the overall population of dwarfs. We conclude that a\nsmall but significant fraction of them - typically a few percent, and possibly\nmore in dense environments or around early-type galaxies - could be of tidal\norigin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2006 07:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

While the number density of luminous (massive) ETGs with\nM_B(z=0)< -20.5 (Mass > 10^11 M_Sun) is nearly constant since z~0.8, less\nluminous galaxies display a deficit which grows with redshift and that can be\nexplained with a gradual population of the ETG \"red sequence\" by the\nprogressive quenching of star formation in galaxies less massive than ~10^11\nM_Sun. At each redshift there is a critical mass above which virtually all ETGs\nappear to be in place, and this fits well in the now popular \"downsizing\"\nscenario.

Observations of the pure\nrotational H2 lines S(3) 9.67um, S(2) 12.28um, and S(1) 17.04um are used to\nderive the temperature and mass of the warm molecular gas. We detect H2 in 77%\nof the sample, and all ULIRGs with F(60um)>2Jy. The average warm molecular gas\nmass is ~2x10^8solar-masses. High extinction, inferred from the 9.7um silicate\nabsorption depth, is not observed along the line of site to the molecular gas.\nThe derived H2 mass does not depend on F(25um)/F(60um), which has been used to\ninfer either starburst or AGN dominance. Similarly, the molecular mass does not\nscale with the 25 or 60um luminosities. In general, the H2 emission is\nconsistent with an origin in photo-dissociation regions associated with star\nformation. We detect the S(0) 28.22um emission line in a few ULIRGs. Including\nthis line in the model fits tends to lower the temperature by ~50-100K,\nresulting in a significant increase in the gas mass. The presence of a cooler\ncomponent cannot be ruled out in the remainder of our sample, for which we do\nnot detect the S(0) line. The measured S(7) 5.51um line fluxes in six ULIRGs\nimplies ~3x10^6 solar-masses of hot (~1400K) H2. The warm gas mass is typically\nless than 1% of the cold gas mass derived from CO observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 May 2006 13:41:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Jun 2006 15:27:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Although there is a strong consensus that\ngeneral laws in biology may exist, opinions opposing such suggestion are\nabundant. Based on recent progress in both mathematics and biology, another\nattempt to address this issue is made in the present article. Specifically,\nthree laws which form a mathematical framework for the evolutionary dynamics in\nbiology are postulated. The second law is most quantitative and is explicitly\nexpressed in the unique form of a stochastic differential equation. Salient\nfeatures of Darwinian evolutionary dynamics are captured by this law: the\nprobabilistic nature of evolution, ascendancy, and the adaptive landscape. Four\ndynamical elements are introduced in this formulation: the ascendant matrix,\nthe transverse matrix, the Wright evolutionary potential, and the stochastic\ndrive. The first law may be regarded as a special case of the second law. It\ngives the reference point to discuss the evolutionary dynamics. The third law\ndescribes the relationship between the focused level of description to its\nlower and higher ones, and defines the dichotomy of deterministic and\nstochastic drives. It is an acknowledgement of the hierarchical structure in\nbiology. A new interpretation of Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural\nselection is provided in terms of the F-Theorem. The proposed laws are based on\ncontinuous representation in both time and population. Their generic nature is\ndemonstrated through their equivalence to classical formulations.
