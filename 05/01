The effect of these encounters has previously been studied analytically\nfor two cases: 1) head-on encounters, for which the cluster moves through the\ncentre of the GMC and 2) distant encounters, where the encounter distance p >\n3*R_n, with p the encounter parameter and R_n the radius of the GMC. We\nintroduce an expression for the energy gain of the cluster due to GMC\nencounters valid for all values of p and R_n. This analytical result is\nconfronted with results from N-body simulations and excellent agreement is\nfound. From the simulations we find that the fractional mass loss is only 25%\nof the fractional energy gain. This is because stars escape with velocities\nmuch higher than the escape velocity. Based on the mass loss, we derive a\ndisruption time for star clusters due to encounters with GMCs of the form t_dis\n[Gyr] = 2.0*S*(M_c/10^4 M_sun)^gamma, with S=1 for the solar neighbourhood and\ninversely proportional with the global GMC density and gamma=1-3lambda, with\nlambda the index that relates the cluster half-mass radius to the cluster mass\n(r_h ~ M_c^lambda). The observed shallow relation between cluster radius and\nmass (e.g. lambda=0.1), makes the index (gamma=0.7) similar to the index found\nboth from observations and from simulations of clusters dissolving in tidal\nfields (gamma=0.62). The constant of 2.0 Gyr, which is the disruption time of a\n10^4 M_sun cluster in the solar neighbourhood, is close to the value of 1.3 Gyr\nwhich was empirically determined from the age distribution of open clusters.\nThis suggests that the combined effect of GMC encounters, stellar evolution and\ngalactic tidal field can explain the lack of old open clusters in the solar\nneighbourhood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2006 10:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

By using the local density\napproximation (LDA), the high-energy band structure is obtained, while screened\nCoulomb interactions are derived from the constrained LDA and the GW method.\nThe renormalization of the kinetic energy is determined from the GW method. By\nthese downfolding procedures, an effective Hamiltonian at low energies is\nderived. Applying the path integral renormalization group method to this\nHamiltonian, we obtain ground state properties such as the magnetic and orbital\norders. Obtained results are consistent with experiments within available data.\nWe find that ${\\rm Sr_{2}VO_{4}}$ is close to the metal-insulator transition.\nFurthermore, because of the coexistence and competition of ferromagnetic and\nantiferromgnetic exchange interactions in this system, an antiferromagnetic and\norbital-ordered state with a nontrivial and large unit cell structure is\npredicted in the ground state. The calculated optical conductivity shows\ncharacteristic shoulder structure in agreement with the experimental results.\nThis suggests an orbital selective reduction of the Mott gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 May 2006 06:09:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\nmost significant aspect of the proposed gate is that it can work singly as a\nreversible full adder, that is reversible full adder can now be implemented\nwith a single gate only. This paper proposes a NXN reversible multiplier using\nTSG gate. It is based on two concepts. The partial products can be generated in\nparallel with a delay of d using Fredkin gates and thereafter the addition can\nbe reduced to log2N steps by using reversible parallel adder designed from TSG\ngates.

It is demonstrated that the proposed multiplier architecture\nusing the TSG gate is much better and optimized, compared to its existing\ncounterparts in literature; in terms of number of reversible gates and garbage\noutputs.

This paper\nfocuses on a prime modulus, p, for which it is shown that the basic structure\nof the functional graph is largely dependent on an interaction between g and\np-1. In fact, there are precisely as many different functional graph structures\nas there are divisors of p-1. This paper extracts two of these structures,\npermutations and binary functional graphs. Estimates exist for the shape of a\nrandom permutation, but similar estimates must be created for the binary\nfunctional graphs. Experimental data suggests that both the permutations and\nbinary functional graphs correspond well to the theoretical data which provides\nmotivation to extend this to larger divisors of p-1 and study the impact this\nforced structure has on the many cryptographic algorithms that rely on the\ndiscrete logarithm for their security.

Here we prove a continuity theorem for Stinespring's dilation:\nif two quantum channels are close in cb-norm, then it is always possible to\nfind unitary implementations which are close in operator norm, with\ndimension-independent bounds. This result generalizes Uhlmann's theorem from\nstates to channels and allows to derive a formulation of the\ninformation-disturbance tradeoff in terms of quantum channels, as well as a\ncontinuity estimate for the no-broadcasting theorem. We briefly discuss further\nimplications for quantum cryptography, thermalization processes, and the black\nhole information loss puzzle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Apr 2006 18:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
