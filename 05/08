The first\ncavity is prepared in a well defined Fock state with two photons with opposite\ncircular polarizations while the second cavity remains in the vacuum state. A\nhalf-of-a-resonant Rabi oscillation in each cavity transfers one photon from\nthe first to the second cavity, leaving the photons entangled in their\npolarization degree of freedom. The feasibility of this implementation and some\npractical considerations are discussed for both, microwave and optical regimes.\nIn particular, Monte Carlo wave function simulations have been performed with\nstate-of-the-art parameter values to evaluate the success probability of the\ncavity-QED source in producing entangled photon pairs as well as its\nentanglement capability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 May 2006 11:51:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 May 2006 15:46:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
