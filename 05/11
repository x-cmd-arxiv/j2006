No dependence of accretion rate on stellar\nmass is predicted by the simplest version of the layered disk model of Gammie\n(1996), in which non-thermal ionization of upper disk layers allows accretion\nto occur via the magnetorotational instability. We show that a minor\nmodification of Gammie's model to include heating by irradiation from the\ncentral star yields a modest dependence of $\\mdot$ upon the mass of the central\nstar. A purely viscous disk model could provide a strong dependence of\naccretion rate on stellar mass if the initial disk radius (before much viscous\nevolution has occurred) has a strong dependence on stellar mass.

This\nfinding suggests that such flows may be more luminous than predicted by the\nstandard accretion disk model. Here we apply a prescription for heat\ndissipation within the simulated accretion flows to estimate their implied\nradiative efficiency. We assume that dissipation is proportional to the current\ndensity squared, and find that the resulting azimuthally-averaged and\nshell-integrated radial profile is well-matched to the radial heat dissipation\nprofile of the standard disk model for the region outside the ISCO,\nparticularly when it is adjusted to account for additional stress at the ISCO.\nIn contrast to the standard model, however, the dissipation profile derived\nfrom the current density continues past the ISCO and through the plunging\nregion. The total predicted dissipation rate is between $\\simeq 30%$ and\n$\\simeq 100%$ greater than that predicted by the standard model, depending on\nthe black hole spin. Most of the additional dissipation takes place just\noutside the ISCO. To predict luminosities, we assume instantaneous radiation\nand zero optical depth, but allow for photon capture. The net radiative\nefficiency seen by a distant observer is increased relative to the standard\nmodel by $\\simeq 25%$--80%, with the largest fractional increase for\nintermediate black hole spins because the increase in dissipation from enhanced\nstress that occurs for rapid spin is partially offset by the increased\nlikelihood that the additional photons will be captured by the hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 May 2006 15:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

These dominant error events will be both code and decoder\ndependent, consisting of low-weight codewords as well as non-codeword events if\nML decoding is not used.
