The general structure of the phase\ndiagrams is analysed. At a high ratio of uniaxial anisotropy to\nantiferromagnetic interlayer exchange, only a succession of collinear magnetic\nstates is possible. With increasing field first-order (metamagnetic)\ntransitions occur from the antiferromagnetic ground-state to a set of\ndegenerate ferrimagnetic states and to the saturated ferromagnetic state. At\nlow anisotropies, a first-order transition from the antiferromagnetic\nground-state to an inhomogeneous spin-flop state occurs. Between these two\nregions, transitional magnetic phases occupy the range of intermediate\nanisotropies. Detailed and quantitative phase diagrams are given for the basic\nmodel of antiferromagnetic multilayer systems with N = 2 to 16 layers. The\nconnection of the phase diagrams with the spin-reorientation transitions in\nbulk antiferromagnets is discussed. The limits of low anisotropy and large\nnumbers of layers are analysed by two different representations of the magnetic\nenergy, namely, in terms of finite chains of staggered vectors and in a general\ncontinuum form. It is shown that the phenomena widely described as ``surface\nspin-flop'' are driven only by the cut exchange interactions and the\nnon-compensated magnetic moment at the surface layers of a stacked\nantiferromagnetic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 May 2006 16:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

They are commonly used to compare reconstructed trees to evolutionary\nmodels and to find evidence of tree reconstruction bias. Historically, to find\na useful tree shape statistic, formulas have been invented by hand and then\nevaluated for utility. This article presents the first method which is capable\nof optimizing over a class of tree shape statistics, called Binary Recursive\nTree Shape Statistics (BRTSS). After defining the BRTSS class, a set of\nalgebraic expressions is defined which can be used in the recursions. The tree\nshape statistics definable using these expressions in the BRTSS is very\ngeneral, and includes many of the statistics with which phylogenetic\nresearchers are already familiar. We then present a practical genetic algorithm\nwhich is capable of performing optimization over BRTSS given any objective\nfunction. The chapter concludes with a successful application of the methods to\nfind a new statistic which indicates a significant difference between two\ndistributions on trees which were previously postulated to have similar\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2006 02:07:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Sep 2006 06:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
