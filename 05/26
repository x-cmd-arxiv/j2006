Using a galaxy\nformation model grafted onto the Millennium Simulation of the LCDM cosmogony,\nwe study how assembly bias affects galaxy clustering. We compare the original\nsimulation to `shuffled' versions where the galaxy populations are randomly\nswapped among halos of similar mass, thus isolating the effects of correlations\nbetween assembly history and environment at fixed mass. Such correlations are\nignored in the halo occupation distribution models often used populate dark\nmatter simulations with galaxies, but they are significant in our more\nrealistic simulation. Assembly bias enhances 2-point correlations by 10% for\ngalaxies with M_bJ-5logh brighter than -17, but suppresses them by a similar\namount for galaxies brighter than -20. When such samples are split by colour,\nassembly bias is 5% stronger for red galaxies and 5% weaker for blue ones. Halo\ncentral galaxies are differently affected by assembly bias than are galaxies of\nall types. It almost doubles the correlation amplitude for faint red central\ngalaxies. Shuffling galaxies among halos of fixed formation redshift or\nconcentration in addition to fixed mass produces biases which are not much\nsmaller than when mass alone is fixed. Assembly bias must reflect a correlation\nof environment with aspects of halo assembly which are not encoded in either of\nthese parameters.

Our SBF data are inconsistent at the 3\nsigma level with a colour independent absolute SBF magnitude Mbar_I, presenting\na problem for SBF models that predict such a flat relation. There is a weak\nindication in our data (1.8 sigma) to favour a two-branch calibration over a\none-branch calibration with broad scatter in the Mbar_I - (V-I) plane. We\nobtain the following one-branch empirical SBF calibration:\n  Mbar_I=-2.13 (+/- 0.17) + 2.44 (+/- 1.94) * [(V-I)_0 - 1.00] mag.\n  We deduce a 0.34 +/- 0.14 mag cosmic scatter of Mbar_I, which is\nsignificantly larger than found at redder colours. This is in agreement with\nthose theoretical SBF models that predict Mbar_I to be more sensitive to\nage-metallicity variations in the blue than in the red. We find evidence that\nthe fainter galaxies in our samples contain younger and more metal-rich stellar\npopulations than the brighter ones. The application of our empirical\ncalibration to published SBF measurements of Hydra and Centaurus cluster dEs\nleaves the distances to both clusters unchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2006 11:28:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we study evolution of the energy spectra of relativistic\nelectrons under different assumptions about the acceleration and energy-loss\nrates of electrons, and the impact of these processes on the lightcurve of IC\ngamma-rays. We demonstrate that the observed TeV lightcurve can be explained\n(i) by adiabatic losses which dominate over the entire trajectory of the pulsar\nwith a significant increase towards the periastron, or (ii) by the sub-TeV\ncutoffs in the energy spectra of electrons due to the enhanced rate of Compton\nlosses close to the periastron. The Compton deceleration of the pulsar wind\ncontributes to the decrease of the nonthermal power released in the accelerated\nelectrons, and thus to the reduction of the IC and synchrotron components of\nradiation close to the periastron.
