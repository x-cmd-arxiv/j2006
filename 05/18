The Fe line luminosity provides the best X-ray indicator of the unseen\nintrinsic AGN luminosity. In detail, the morphologies of the extended soft\nX-ray emission and optical line emission are similar, and line emission\ndominates the soft X-ray spectra. Thus, we attribute the soft X-ray emission to\nmaterial that the central engines photoionize. Because the resulting spectra\nare complex and do not reveal the AGNs directly, crude analysis techniques such\nas hardness ratios would mis-classify these galaxies as hosts of intrinsically\nweak, unabsorbed AGNs and would fail to identify the luminous, absorbed nuclei\nthat are present. We demonstrate that a three-band X-ray diagnostic can\ncorrectly classify Compton thick AGNs, even when significant soft X-ray line\nemission is present.

In a matter-free configuration and in the torsionless\nsector, the field equations are too strong a restriction on the geometry as the\nmetric must satisfy both the Einstein and pure Gauss-Bonnet equations. In\nparticular, the five-dimensional Schwarzschild geometry fails to be a solution;\nhowever, configurations corresponding to a brane-world with positive\ncosmological constant on the worldsheet are admissible when one of the matter\nfields is switched on. These results can be extended to higher odd dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2006 18:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

In China, there is a law and regulation\nsystem for tendering and bidding. However, few works on the mathematical model\nof a tendering and its evaluation can be found in publication. The main purpose\nof this paper is to construct a Smarandache multi-space model for a tendering,\nestablish an evaluation system for bidding based on those ideas in the\nreferences [7] and [8] and analyze its solution by applying the decision\napproach for multiple objectives and value engineering. Open problems for\npseudo-multi-spaces are also presented in the final section.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 May 2006 02:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
