The ability to reliably constrain the contribution of faint\ngalaxies is critical and our data do so as they reach to M*+2 even at z~4 and\ndeeper still at lower redshifts. We find that the luminosity density at high\nredshift is dominated by the hitherto poorly studied galaxies fainter than L*,\nand, indeed, the the bulk of the UV light in the high-z Universe comes from\ngalaxies in the luminosity range L=0.1-1L*. It is these faint galaxies that\ngovern the behavior of the total UV luminosity density. Overall, there is a\ngradual rise in luminosity density starting at z~4 or earlier, followed by a\nshallow peak or a plateau within z~3--1, and then followed by the well-know\nplunge at lower redshifts. Within this total picture, luminosity density in\nsub-L* galaxies evolves more rapidly at high redshift, z>~2, than that in more\nluminous objects. However, this is reversed at lower redshifts, z<~1, a\nreversal that is reminiscent of galaxy downsizing. Within the context of the\nmodels commonly used in the observational literature, there seemingly aren't\nenough faint or bright LBGs to maintain ionization of intergalactic gas even as\nlate as z~4. This is particularly true at earlier epochs and even more so if\nthe faint-end evolutionary trends we observe at z~3 and 4 continue to higher\nredshifts. Apparently the Universe must be easier to reionize than some recent\nstudies have assumed. Nevertheless, sub-L* galaxies do dominate the total UV\nluminosity density at z>~2 and this dominance further highlights the need for\nfollow-up studies that will teach us more about these very numerous but thus\nfar largely unexplored systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2006 02:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In each arms of the interferometers, energies are filtered\nwith coherent quantum dots. In contrast to previous studies of zero-frequency\ncross-correlations of electrical currents for this system, attention is drawn\nto finite-time measurements. This allows to observe two-particle interference\nfor particles with different energies above and below Fermi level. Entanglement\nis first characterized via the concurrence for the two-particle spatial density\nmatrix. Next, we formulate the Bell inequality, which is written in terms of\nfinite-time noise correlators, and thereby we find a specific set of parameters\nfor which entanglement can be detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2006 08:13:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 May 2006 02:01:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Asymmetric transactions\nare typical for chain-trading groups who arrange their business such that\ncommodities move from senior to junior partners and money moves in the opposite\ndirection. The price-invariance of transactions means that the probability of a\npairwise interaction is a function of the ratio of incomes, which is\nindependent of the price scale or absolute income level. These two features\ncharacterize the hierarchical model. The income distribution in this class of\nmodels is a well-defined double-Pareto function, which possesses Pareto tails\nfor the upper and lower incomes. For gross and net upper incomes, the model\npredicts definite values of the Pareto exponents, $a_{\\rm gross}$ and $a_{\\rm\nnet}$, which are stable with respect to quantitative variation of the\npair-interaction. The Pareto exponents are also stable with respect to the\nchoice of a demand function within two classes of status-dependent behavior of\nagents: linear demand ($a_{\\rm gross}=1$, $a_{\\rm net}=2$) and unlimited slowly\nvarying demand ($a_{\\rm gross}=a_{\\rm net}=1$). For the sigmoidal demand that\ndescribes limited returns, $a_{\\rm gross}=a_{\\rm net}=1+\\alpha$, with some\n$\\alpha>0$ satisfying a transcendental equation. The low-income distribution\nmay be singular or vanishing in the neighborhood of the minimal income; in any\ncase, it is $L_1$-integrable and its Pareto exponent is given explicitly.\n  The theory used in the present study is based on a simple balance equation\nand new results from multiplicative Markov chains and exponential moments of\nrandom geometric progressions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 May 2006 06:12:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We show that the classical\nBurton-Prim-Slichter (BPS) solution describing the effect of a diverging flow\non the solute incorporation into the solidifying material breaks down for the\nflows converging along the solidification front. The breakdown is caused by a\ndivergence of the integral defining the effective boundary layer thickness\nwhich is the basic concept of the BPS theory. Although such a divergence can\nformally be avoided by restricting the axial extension of the melt to a layer\nof finite height, radially uniform solute distributions are possible only for\nweak melt flows with an axial velocity away from the solidification front\ncomparable to the growth rate. There is a critical melt velocity for each\ngrowth rate at which the solution passes through a singularity and becomes\nphysically inconsistent for stronger melt flows. To resolve these\ninconsistencies we consider a solidification front presented by a disk of\nfinite radius $R_0$ subject to a strong converging melt flow and obtain an\nanalytic solution showing that the radial solute concentration depends on the\nradius $r$ as $\\sim\\ln^{1/3}(R_0/r)$ and $\\sim\\ln(R_0/r)$ close to the rim and\nat large distances from it. The logarithmic increase of concentration is\nlimited in the vicinity of the symmetry axis by the diffusion becoming\neffective at a distance comparable to the characteristic thickness of the\nsolute boundary layer. The converging flow causes a solute pile-up forming a\nlogarithmic concentration peak at the symmetry axis which might be an\nundesirable feature for crystal growth processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2006 16:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Proportionate contrarians are thus found to\nindeed preserve the former case main results. However, restricting the\ncontrarian behavior to only the current collective majority, makes the dynamics\nmore complex with novel features. For a density a<a_c=1/9 of one-sided\ncontrarians, a chaotic basin is found in the fifty-fifty region separated from\ntwo majority-minority point attractors, one on each side.

We view modeling as search through a space of\ncandidate models that is guided by model objectives, theoretical knowledge, and\nempirical data. In this contribution, we introduce a method for representing\nprocess-based models that facilitates the discovery of models that explain\nobserved behavior. This representation casts dynamic systems as interacting\nsets of processes that act on entities. Using this approach, a modeler first\nencodes relevant ecological knowledge into a library of generic entities and\nprocesses, then instantiates these theoretical components, and finally\nassembles candidate models from these elements. We illustrate this methodology\nwith a model of the Ross Sea ecosystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2006 23:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
