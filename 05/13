If a noise transient in the detector output originates\nfrom channel X, it leaves the statistics of the noise-component of H orthogonal\nto X unchanged, which can be verified by a statistical hypothesis testing. This\nstrategy is demonstrated by doing software injections in simulated Gaussian\nnoise. We also formulate a less-rigorous, but computationally inexpensive\nalternative to the above method.
