This mechanism of galaxy building can proceed either by\nrepeated major mergers with other systems, or by means of accretion of matter\nfrom the surrounding regions. AIMS.In this paper we compare the properties of\nlocal disk galaxies that appear isolated, i.e. not tidally affected by other\ngalaxies during the last few Gyr within the volume given by cz<= 5000 km/s,\nwith those galaxies at z values from 0.25 to 5.\n  METHODS.Effective radii for 203 isolated galaxies and 1645 galaxies from the\nRC3 have been collected and the two samples have been analyzed statistically. A\nsimilar comparison has been made with half light radii studied at high z from\nthe literature.\n  RESULTS.We found that isolated galaxies are in general smaller than other\npresent epoch galaxies from the RC3. We notice the lack of systems larger than\n7 kpc among them. Their size distribution appears to be similar to that of\ngalaxies at 1.4 <= z <= 2. The models of the merging history also indicate that\nthe isolated galaxies did stop their merging process at about that redshift,\nevolving passively since then. The galaxy density seems to have remained\nunchanged since that epoch.\n  CONCLUSIONS.Isolated galaxies appears to be the end products of the merging\nprocess as proposed in the hierarchical accretion scenario at around z=1.4. For\nthis class of galaxies this was the last significant merging event in their\nlives and have evolved passively since then. This is confirmed by the\nanalytical estimate of the merging fraction with z and by the comparison with\nsizes of distant galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2006 17:08:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 May 2006 13:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\nkey reaction is the deuteron exchange in the reaction between HD, the reservoir\nof deuterium in dark interstellar clouds, and the H3+ molecular ion, leading to\nthe production of the H2D+ molecule, and the low temperature in dark\ninterstellar clouds favors this production. Furthermore, the presence of\nmultiply deuterated species have incited our group to proceed further and\nconsider the subsequent reaction of H2D+ with HD, leading to D2H+ (first\ndetected by Vastel et al. 2004), which can further react with HD to produce\nD3+. In prestellar cores, where CO was found to be depleted (Bacmann et al.\n2003), this production should be increased, as CO would normally destroy H3+.\nThe first model including D2H+ and D3+ (Roberts, Herbst & Millar 2003)\npredicted that these molecules should be as abundant as H2D+ (see contribution\nby H. Roberts).

Using a careful analysis of magnetization curves and ZFC\nsusceptibility measurements, we determine the clusters magnetic anisotropy\nenergy (MAE) and separate the surface and volume contributions. By comparing\ndifferent chemical compositions, we show that a small amount of Pt (15%)\ninduces an important increase in the volume anisotropy with respect to pure Co\nclusters, even in chemically disordered fcc clusters. Comparing the\nmeasurements of clusters embedded in Nb and MgO matrices, we show that the\noxide matrix induces an important increase of the surface MAE attributed to the\nformation of an antiferromagnetic CoO shell around the clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2006 12:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The theory is based on the\nimproved description of the conduction electron coupling to the external\nelectromagnetic fields, distinguishing further the direct and indirect\n(assisted) scattering on the quasi-static disorder. The two scattering channels\nare distinguished in terms of the energy and momentum conservation laws. The\ntheory is illustrated on the Emery three-band model for the normal state of the\nunderdoped high-$T_c$ cuprates which includes the incoherent electron\nscattering on the disorder associated with the quasi-static fluctuations around\nthe static antiferromagnetic (AF) ordering. It is shown, for the first time\nconsistently, that the incoherent indirect processes dominate the low-frequency\npart of the Raman spectra, while the long-range screening which is dynamic\nremoves the long-range forces in the $A_{1g}$ channel. In the mid-infrared\nfrequency range the coherent AF processes are dominant. In contrast to the\nnonresonant $B_{1g}$ response, which is large by itself, the resonant interband\ntransitions enhance both the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{1g}$ Raman spectra to comparable\nvalues, in good agreement with experimental observation. It is further argued\nthat the AF correlations give rise to the mid-infrared peak in the $B_{1g}$\nRaman spectrum, accompanied by a similar peak in the optical conductivity. The\ndoping behavior of these peaks is shown to be correlated with the linear doping\ndependence of the Hall number, as observed in all underdoped high-$T_c$\ncompounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 May 2006 10:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 2007 07:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nrelate correlation properties of column sequences to that of the companion pair\nand illustrate how to select an appropriate companion pair to ensure that a\ngiven column correlation constraint is satisfied. For $t=0$, companion pair\nproperties directly determine matrix column correlation properties.

The approach passes through the identification of locally stable\nand unstable manifolds (the Lyapunov vectors), thereby revealing an analogy\nwith generalized synchronization. The method is then applied to a periodically\nforced chaotic oscillator to show that the modulus of the Lyapunov exponent\nassociated to the phase dynamics increases quadratically with the coupling\nstrength and it is therefore different from zero already below the onset of\nphase-synchronization. The analytical calculations are carried out for a model,\nthe generalized special flow, that we construct as a simplified version of the\nperiodically forced Rossler oscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 May 2006 18:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
