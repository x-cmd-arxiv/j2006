The\ncentral regions are fitted by elliptical isophotes whose centres are allowed to\nvary to get the best fit. The centres of isophotes show a striking sloshing\npattern with a spatial variation of up to 20-30 % within the central 1 kpc.\nThis indicates mass asymmetry and a dynamically unrelaxed behaviour. Next, we\nFourier-analyze the galaxy images while keeping the centre constant and measure\nthe deviation from axisymmetry in terms of the fractional Fourier amplitudes\n(A_1, A_2 etc) as a function of radius. All mergers show a high value of\nlopsidedness (upto A_1 ~ 0.2) in the central 5 kpc. The m=2 asymmetry is even\nstronger, with values of A_2 upto ~ 0.3, and in three cases these are shown to\nrepresent bars. The corresponding values denoting non-axisymmetry in inner\nregions of a control sample of eight non-merger galaxies are found to be\nseveral times smaller. Surprisingly, this central asymmetry is seen even in\nmergers where the outer regions have relaxed into a smooth elliptical-like\nr^{1/4} profile or a spiral-like exponential profile. Thus the central\nasymmetry is long-lived, estimated to be ~ 1 Gyr, and hence lasts for over 100\nlocal dynamical timescales.

In strongly\ninteracting gases, such as the recently observed fermionic superfluids, this\nclear separation between the superfluid and the normal parts of the cloud is no\nlonger given.

Most surfaces of solids have roughness on\nmany different length scales, and when calculating the friction force it is\nnecessary to include the viscoelastic deformations on all length scales.

Since the\nviscoelastic properties of rubber-like materials are extremely strongly\ntemperature dependent, it is necessary to include the local temperature\nincrease in the analysis. At very low sliding velocity the temperature increase\nis negligible because of heat diffusion, but already for velocities of order\n0.01 m/s the local heating may be very important.

In this\npaper, we examine these choices in detail for the quasiequilibrium method\ncoupled to apparent-horizon/quasiequilibrium boundary conditions. First, we\ncompare two independent criteria for choosing the orbital frequency, the\n\"Komar-mass condition\" and the \"effective-potential method,\" and find excellent\nagreement. Second, we implement quasi-local measures of the spin of the\nindividual holes, calibrate these with corotating binaries, and revisit the\nconstruction of non-spinning black hole binaries. Higher-order effects, beyond\nthose considered in earlier work, turn out to be important. Without those,\nsupposedly non-spinning black holes have appreciable quasi-local spin;\nfurthermore, the Komar-mass condition and effective potential method agree only\nwhen these higher-order effects are taken into account. We compute a new\nsequence of quasi-circular orbits for non-spinning black-hole binaries, and\ndetermine the innermost stable circular orbit of this sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 May 2006 21:18:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2006 13:46:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Sep 2006 20:29:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We found that\nthe asymptotic 1/Q^2 behavior of F_M (Q^2) is generated by soft Feynman\nmechanism rather than by short distance dynamics, which causes very late onset\nof the 1/Q^2 asymptotic behavior. Using meromorphization for spin-1/2 quarks,\nwe demonstrated that resulting form factor F^{spinor}_M (Q^2) has 1/Q^4\nasymptotic behavior. Now, owing to the late onset of this asymptotic pattern,\n  F^{spinor}_M (Q^2) imitates the 1/Q^2 behavior in the few GeV^2 region.\n  We discuss analogy between meromorphization and local quark-hadron duality\nmodel for the pion form factor, and show that adding the O(\\alpha_s) correction\nto the spectral function brings in the hard pQCD contribution that has the\ndimensional counting $1/Q^2$ behavior at large Q^2.

A factorisation of a complete graph $K_n$\nis a partition of its edges into disjoint classes. Each class of edges in a\nfactorisation of $K_n$ corresponds to a spanning subgraph called a factor. If\nall the factors are isomorphic to one another, then a factorisation of $K_n$ is\ncalled an isomorphic factorisation. A homogeneous factorisation of a complete\ngraph is an isomorphic factorisation where there exists a group $G$ which\npermutes the factors transitively, and a normal subgroup $M$ of $G$ such that\neach factor is $M$-vertex-transitive. If $M$ also acts edge-transitively on\neach factor, then a homogeneous factorisation of $K_n$ is called an\nedge-transitive homogeneous factorisation. The aim of this thesis is to study\nedge-transitive homogeneous factorisations of $K_n$.

Two\northonormal bases in $\\mathbb C^d, B {and} B'$ are said mutually unbiased if\n$\\forall b\\in B, b'\\in B'$ the scalar product $b\\cdot b'$ has modulus\n$d^{-1/2}$. In particular this property has been introduced in order to allow\nan optimization of the measurement-driven quantum evolution process of any\nstate $\\psi \\in \\mathbb C^d$ when measured in the mutually unbiased bases\n$B\\_{j} {of} \\mathbb C^d$. At present it is an open problem to find the maximal\number of mutually Unbiased Bases when $d$ is not a power of a prime number.\n\\noindent In this article, we revisit the problem of finding Mutually Unbiased\nBases (MUB's) in any dimension $d$. The method is very elementary, using the\nsimple unitary matrices introduced by Schwinger in 1960, together with their\ndiagonalizations. The Vandermonde matrix based on the $d$-th roots of unity\nplays a major role. This allows us to show the existence of a set of 3 MUB's in\nany dimension, to give conditions for existence of more than 3 MUB's for $d$\neven or odd number, and to recover the known result of existence of $d+1$ MUB's\nfor $d$ a prime number. Furthermore the construction of these MUB's is very\nexplicit. As a by-product, we recover results about Gauss Sums, known in number\ntheory, but which have apparently not been previously derived from MUB\nproperties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 May 2006 09:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-12"}

The teleportation\nof a quantum state between two single material particles (trapped ions) has now\nalso been achieved. Here we demonstrate teleportation between objects of a\ndifferent nature - light and matter, which respectively represent 'flying' and\n'stationary' media.

An important factor for the implementation of quantum\nnetworks is the teleportation distance between transmitter and receiver; this\nis 0.5 metres in the present experiment.
