The magnitude of the dissipative phase slips shows that they occur\nsimultaneously in all the apertures when the temperature is around 10 mK below\nthe superfluid transition, and subsequently lose their simultaneity as the\ntemperature is lowered. We find that when periodic synchronous phase slippage\noccurs, the synchronicity exists from the very first phase slip, and therefore\nis not due to mode locking of interacting oscillators. When the system is\nallowed to relax freely from a given initial energy, the total number of phase\nslips that occur and the energy left in the system after the last phase slip\ndepends reproducibly on the initial energy. We find the energy remaining after\nthe final phase slip is a periodic function of the initial system energy.

When the array slips synchronously, this periodic energy function is a\nsharp sawtooth. As the temperature is lowered and the degree of synchronicity\ndrops, the peak of this sawtooth becomes rounded, suggesting a broadening of\nthe time interval over which the array slips.

Simulation\nresults show that there exists a optimal parameter value by considering both\nmaximizing the network capacity and reducing the packet travel time. Comparing\nwith the strategy by adopting exclusive local static information, the new\nstrategy shows its advantages in improving the efficiency of the system. The\ndetailed analysis of the mixing strategy is provided. This work suggests that\nhow to effectively utilize the larger degree nodes plays the key role in the\nscale-free traffic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 May 2006 07:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

When the stress-free condition, equivalent to\nvanishing surface impedance, is relaxed by the introduction of a {spatially-\nconstant, non- vanishing surface impedance}, the response in the substratum is\nagain a single reflected body wave whose amplitude is less than the one in the\nsituation of a stress-free ground. When the stress-free condition is relaxed by\nthe introduction of a a {spatially-modulated surface impedance}, which\nsimulates the action of an uneven (i.e., not entirely-flat) ground, the\nfrequency-domain response takes the form of a spectrum of {plane body waves}\nand {surface waves} and {resonances} are produced at the frequencies of which\none or several surface wave amplitudes can become large. It is shown, that at\nresonance, the amplitude of one, or of several, components of the motion on the\nsurface can be amplified with respect to the situation in which the surface\nimpedance is either constant or vanishes. Also, when the solicitation is\npulse-like, the integrated time history of the square of surface displacement\nand of the square of velocity can be larger, and the duration of the signal can\nbe considerably longer, for a spatially-modulated impedance surface than for a\nconstant, or vanishing, impedance surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 May 2006 10:04:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2006 19:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We observe that protein folds remain\nstable and abundant in the population at time scales much greater than mutation\nor organism lifetime, and the distribution of the lifetimes of dominant folds\nin a population approximately follows a power law. The separation of\nevolutionary time scales between discovery of new folds and generation of new\nsequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and superfamilies whose\nsizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same distributions for\nreal proteins. The network of structural similarities of the universe of\nevolved proteins has the same scale-free like character as the actual protein\ndomain universe graph (PDUG). Further, the model predicts that ancient protein\ndomains represent a highly connected and clustered subset of all protein\ndomains, in complete agreement with reality. Together, these results provide a\nmicroscopic first principles picture of how protein structures and gene\nfamilies evolved in the course of evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 May 2006 23:36:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 2007 22:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

As a result, unless the two modes are close in\nfrequency, a high-frequency shot-noise-limited detection system is needed.
