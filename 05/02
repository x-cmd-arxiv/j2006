The time\ninterval from one glitch to the next obeys a strong linear correlation to the\namplitude of the first glitch, with a mean slope of about 400 days ppm (6.5\ndays per uHz), such that these intervals can be predicted to within a few days,\nan accuracy which has never before been seen in any other pulsar. There appears\nto be an upper limit of ~40 uHz for the size of glitches in_all_ pulsars, with\nthe 1999 April glitch of J0537 as the largest so far. The change in the\nspindown of J0537 across the glitches, Delta(d(nu)/d(t)), appears to have the\nsame hard lower limit of -1.5e-13 Hz/s, as, again, that observed in all other\npulsars. The spindown continues to increase in the long term,\nd(d(nu)/d(t))/d(t) = -1e-21 Hz/s/s, and thus the timing age of J0537 (-0.5 nu\nd(nu)/d(t)) continues to decrease at a rate of nearly one year every year,\nconsistent with movement of its magnetic moment away from its rotational axis\nby one radian every 10,000 years, or about one meter per year. J0537 was likely\nto have been born as a nearly-aligned rotator spinning at 75-80 Hz, with a\n|d(nu)/d(t)| considerably smaller than its current value of 2e-10 Hz/s.

We show that Doppler-phase modulation aids\nsky-position resolution in every direction, improving it especially for sources\nnear the poles of the ecliptic coordinate system. However, it increases the\nfrequency estimation error by a factor of over 1.5 at any sky position, and at\nf=3 mHz. Since accounting for Doppler-phase modulation is absolutely essential\nat all LISA frequencies and for all chirp masses in order to avoid a fractional\nloss of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of more than 30%, LISA science will be\nsimultaneously aided and limited by it. For a source with f > 2.5mHz, searching\nfor its frequency evolution for 1 year worsens the error in the frequency\nestimation by a factor of over 3.5 relative to that of sources with f < 1mHz.\nIncreasing the integration time to 2 years reduces this relative error factor\nto about 2, which still adversely affects the resolvability of the galactic\nbinary confusion noise. Thus, unless the mission lifetime is increased several\nfolds, the only other recourse available for reducing the errors is to exclude\nthe chirp parameter from ones search templates. Doing so improves the\nSNR-normalized parameter estimates. This works for the lightest binaries since\ntheir SNR itself does not suffer from that exclusion.

This inversion of the near-IR fluxes\nis a manifestation of the J-band brightening within this individual binary\nsystem. Therefore, SDSS 1534+1615 demonstrates that the brightening can be\nintrinsic to ultracool photospheres (e.g., arising from cloud disruption and/or\nrapid increase in cloud sedimentation) and does not necessarily result from\nphysical variations among the observed ensemble of T dwarfs (e.g., a range in\nmasses, ages and/or metallicities).

In the present paper we\nset for 3D Potts models (Ising and 3-state) the scale of the dynamical effects\nby comparing to equilibrium results at first and second order phase transition\ntemperatures, obtained by re-weighting from a multicanonical ensemble. Our\nfinding is that the dynamics entirely overwhelms the critical and non-critical\nequilibrium effects.\n  In the second half of the paper we extend our results by investigating the\nGlauber dynamics of pure SU(3) lattice gauge on $N_{\\tau} N_{\\sigma}^3$\nlattices directly under heating quenches from the confined into the deconfined\nregime. The exponential growth factors of the initial response are calculated,\nwhich give Debye screening mass estimates.
