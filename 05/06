Thus, depending on the\nvalues of |V_{ij}| and their accuracy, we can set meaningful limits on |delta|.\nTo illustrate numerically, if |V_{u1}|^2 is close to 0.1 with a 10% precision,\nand if |V_{e3}^2 is larger than 0.005 and for values of |V_{e2}|^2 and\n|V_{u3}|^2 that stay within +-0.1 of the current experimental data leads to a\nbound pi/2 < |delta| < pi.

The entanglement is witnessed\nby the magnetic susceptibility which decides a characteristic temperature for\nan entangled thermal state. The characteristic temperature is nearly\nproportional to the interaction $J$ and the mixed spin $S$. The bound of\nnegativity is obtained on the basis of the magnetic susceptibility. It is found\nthat the macroscopic magnetic properties are affected by the quantum\nentanglement in the real solids.
