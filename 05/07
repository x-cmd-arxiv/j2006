The star was observed in two epochs 39 days apart, with\ndifferent focal plane rotation to allow the subtraction of the instrumental\nPoint Spread Function, achieving a maximum sensitivity of 0.01 MJy/sr at 3.6\nand 4.5 um, and 0.05 MJy/sr at 5.8 and 8.0 um. This sensitivity is not\nsufficient to directly detect scattered or thermal radiation from the epsilon\nEridani debris disk. It is however sufficient to allow the detection of Jovian\nplanets with mass as low as 1 MJ in the IRAC 4.5 um band. In this band, we\ndetected over 460 sources within the 5.70 arcmin field of view of our images.\nTo test if any of these sources could be a low mass companion to epsilon\nEridani, we have compared their colors and magnitudes with models and\nphotometry of low mass objects. Of the sources detected in at least two IRAC\nbands, none fall into the range of mid-IR color and luminosity expected for\ncool, 1 Gyr substellar and planetary mass companions of epsilon Eridani, as\ndetermined by both models and observations of field M, L and T dwarf. We\nidentify three new sources which have detections at 4.5 um only, the lower\nlimit placed on their [3.6]-[4.5] color consistent with models of planetary\nmass objects. Their nature cannot be established with the currently available\ndata and a new observation at a later epoch will be needed to measure their\nproper motion, in order to determine if they are physically associated to\nepsilon Eridani.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 May 2006 23:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

The stochasticity in the model is controlled\nby a temperature-like parameter $\\beta$. Our simulation results show that both\nthe biological stationary state and the biological pathway are stable for a\nwide range of \"temperature\". There is, however, a sharp transition-like\nbehavior at $\\beta_c$, below which the dynamics is dominated by noise. We also\ndefine a pseudo energy landscape for the system in which the biological pathway\ncan be seen as a deep valley.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 May 2006 03:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

We show that the assumption that the state vector is\nreduced whan a latent image is formed, in photography or etched track\ndetection, requires a CSL rate parameter $\\lambda$ that is larger than\nconventionally assumed by a factor of roughly $2 \\times 10^{9\\pm 2}$, for a\ncorrelation length $r_C$ of $10^{-5}{\\rm cm}$. We reanalyze existing upper\nbounds on the reduction rate and conclude that all are compatible with such an\nincrease in $\\lambda$. The best bounds that we have obtained come from a\nconsideration of heating of the intergalactic medium (IGM), which shows that\n$\\lambda$ can be at most $\\sim 10^{8\\pm 1}$ times as large as the standard CSL\nvalue, again for $r_C=10^{-5} {\\rm cm}$. (For both the lower and upper bounds,\nquoted errors are not purely statistical errors, but rather are estimates\nreflecting modeling uncertainties.) We discuss modifications in our analysis\ncorresponding to a larger value of $r_C$.
