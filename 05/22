Understanding the nature\nof its multi-stage outburst and similar systems is challenging. So far, several\nscenarios have been invoked to explain this group of stars. In this work, the\nplanets-swallowing model for V838 Mon is further investigated, taking into\naccount the findings that the progenitor is most likely a massive B type star.\nWe find that the super-Eddington luminosity during the eruption can explain the\nfast rising times of the three peaks in the optical light curve. We used two\ndifferent methods to estimate the location where the planets were consumed.\nThere is a nice agreement between the values obtained from the luminosities of\nthe peaks and from their rising time scale. We estimate that the planets were\nstopped at a typical distance of one solar radius from the center of the host\ngiant star. The planets-devouring model seems to give a satisfying explanation\nto the differences in the luminosities and rising times of the three peaks in\nthe optical light curve of V838 Mon. The peaks may be explained by the\nconsumption of three planets or alternatively by three steps in the terminal\nfalling process of a single planet. We argue that only the binary merger and\nthe planets-swallowing models are consistent with the observations of the new\ntype of stars defined by V838 Mon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2006 09:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

It can synchronise\npopulations of interacting species, stabilise them, and diversify gene pools\n[1-3]. Human travelling, e.g. is responsible for the geographical spread of\nhuman infectious disease [4-9]. In the light of increasing international trade,\nintensified human mobility and an imminent influenza A epidemic [10] the\nknowledge of dynamical and statistical properties of human travel is thus of\nfundamental importance. Despite its crucial role, a quantitative assessment of\nthese properties on geographical scales remains elusive and the assumption that\nhumans disperse diffusively still prevails in models. Here we report on a solid\nand quantitative assessment of human travelling statistics by analysing the\ncirculation of bank notes in the United States. Based on a comprehensive\ndataset of over a million individual displacements we find that dispersal is\nanomalous in two ways. First, the distribution of travelling distances decays\nas a power law, indicating that trajectories of bank notes are reminiscent of\nscale free random walks known as Levy flights. Secondly, the probability of\nremaining in a small, spatially confined region for a time T is dominated by\nalgebraically long tails which attenuate the superdiffusive spread. We show\nthat human travelling behaviour can be described mathematically on many\nspatiotemporal scales by a two parameter continuous time random walk model to a\nsurprising accuracy and conclude that human travel on geographical scales is an\nambivalent effectively superdiffusive process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2006 06:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In this chapter we shall\nsee how a 2-component Bose-Einstein condensate can be used to model a specific\nclass of pseudo-Finsler geometries, and after suitable tuning of parameters,\nboth bi-metric pseudo-Riemannian geometries and standard single metric\npseudo-Riemannian geometries, while independently allowing the quasi-particle\nexcitations to exhibit a \"mass\". Furthermore, when extrapolated to extremely\nhigh energy the quasi-particles eventually leave the phononic regime and begin\nto act like free bosons. Thus this analogue spacetime exhibits an analogue of\nthe \"Lorentz violation\" that is now commonly believed to occur at or near the\nPlanck scale defined by the interplay between quantum physics and gravitational\nphysics. In the 2-component Bose-Einstein analogue spacetime we will show that\nthe mass generating mechanism for the quasi-particles is related to the size of\nthe Lorentz violations. This relates the \"mass hierarchy\" to the so-called\n\"naturalness problem\". In short the analogue spacetime based on 2-component\nBose-Einstein condensates exhibits a very rich mathematical and physical\nstructure that can be used to investigate many issues of interest to the\nhigh-energy physics, cosmology, and general relativity communities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 May 2006 11:28:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Recent and\nongoing studies are discussed for different experimental topologies in the\ndetector. First results are presented for small mass differences between the\nscalar top and neutralino masses. This corresponds to a small expected visible\nenergy in the detector. An ILC will be a unique accelerator to explore this\nscenario. In addition to finding the existence of light stop quarks, the\nprecise measurement of their properties is crucial for testing their impact on\nthe dark matter relic abundance and the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis.\nSignificant sensitivity for mass differences down to 5 GeV are obtained. The\nsimulation is based on a fast and realistic detector simulation. A vertex\ndetector concept of the Linear Collider Flavor Identification\n(LCFI)collaboration, which studies pixel detectors for heavy quark flavour\nidentification, is implemented in the simulations for c-quark tagging. The\nstudy extends simulations for large mass differences (large visible energy) for\nwhich aspects of different detector simulations, the vertex detector design,\nand different methods for the determination of the scalar top mass are\ndiscussed.

Cluster state quantum computing (recently\nproposed by Raussendorf and Briegel) is a new paradigm in quantum information\nprocessing and is a departure from the conventional model of quantum\ncomputation. The cluster state quantum computer begins by creating a highly\nentangled multi-particle state (the cluster state) which it uses as a quantum\nresource during the computation. Information is processed in the computer via\nselected measurements on individual qubits that form the cluster state. We\ndescribe in detail how a scalable quantum computer can be constructed using\nmicrowave cavity QED and, in a departure from the traditional understanding of\na computer as a fixed array of computational elements, we show that cluster\nstate quantum computing is well suited to atomic beam experiments.
