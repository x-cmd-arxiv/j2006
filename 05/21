This suggests that the group environment may play a role in\nthe formation of most galaxies. The Local Group, and other nearby groups,\ndisplay a diversity in star formation and morphological properties that puts\nlimits on how, and when, galaxies in groups formed. Effects that depend on an\nintragroup medium, such as ram-pressure and strangulation, are likely not major\nmechanisms driving group galaxy evolution. Simple dynamical friction arguments\nhowever show that galaxy mergers should be common, and a dominant process for\ndriving evolution. While mergers between L_* galaxies are observed to be rare\nat z < 1, they are much more common at earlier times. This is due to the\nincreased density of the universe, and to the fact that high mass galaxies are\nhighly clustered on the scale of groups. We furthermore discus why the local\nnumber density environment of galaxies strongly correlates with galaxy\nproperties, and why the group environment may be the preferred method for\nestablishing the relationship between properties of galaxies and their local\ndensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2006 23:43:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Oct 2006 20:50:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Our analysis relies on a zero\ntemperature mean-field theory which accurately accounts for initial molecular\nquantum fluctuations, triggering the association process. The structure of the\nresulting semiclassical phase space is investigated, highlighting the dynamical\ninstability of the system towards association, for sufficiently small detuning\nfrom resonance. It is shown that this instability significantly modifies the\nfinite-rate efficiency of the sweep, transforming the single-pair exponential\nLandau-Zener behavior of the remnant fraction of atoms Gamma on sweep rate\nalpha, into a power-law dependence as the number of atoms increases. The\nobtained nonadiabaticity is determined from the interplay of characteristic\ntime scales for the motion of adiabatic eigenstates and for fast periodic\nmotion around them. Critical slowing-down of these precessions near the\ninstability leads to the power-law dependence. A linear power law $Gamma\\propto\nalpha$ is obtained when the initial molecular fraction is smaller than the 1/N\nquantum fluctuations, and a cubic-root power law $Gamma\\propto alpha^{1/3}$ is\nattained when it is larger. Our mean-field analysis is confirmed by exact\ncalculations, using Fock-space expansions. Finally, we fit experimental low\ntemperature Feshbach sweep data with a power-law dependence.

The\ncoefficients c_k of the Pochammer's expansion for the reciprocal of the Riemann\nZeta function, as well as the ``critical functions'' c_k*k^a (where a is some\nconstant), are analyzed at relatively large values of k. It appears an\noscillatory behaviour (Riesz-Hardy-Littlewood wave). The amplitudes and the\nwavelength of the wave are compared with an analytical treatment concerning the\nwave in the asymptotic region. The agreement is satisfactory. We then find\nnumerically that in the large beta limit too, the amplitudes of the waves\nappear to be bounded. For a special case the numerical experiments are\nperformed up to larger values of k, i.e k=10^9 and more. The analysis suggests\nthat RH may barely be true and an absolute bound for the amplitudes of the\nwaves in all cases should be given by |1/(zeta(1/2)+epsilon) -1|, with epsilon\narbitrarily small positive, i.e. equal to 1.68\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 May 2006 23:53:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
