Thanks to the\navailability of deep ugriz exposures, sources are selected from their\nphotometric redshifts. We also use lensing tomography to derive an estimate of\nthe lens redshift. After considering the raw statistics of peaks we check\nwhether they can be associated to a clear optical counterpart or to published\nX-ray selected clusters. RESULTS: Among the 14 peaks found above a\nsignal-to-noise detection threshold nu=3.5, eight are secure detections with\nestimated redshift 0.15<zl<0.6 and a velocity dispersion 450<sigma\\_v<600 km/s.\nThis low mass range is accessible thanks to the high density of background\nsources.

These MLT--\\alpha^2D stellar models and tracks are very\nsimilar to those computed with non--grey ATLAS9 atmospheric boundary conditions\nand Full Spectrum of Turbulence (FST) convection model both in the atmosphere\nand in the interior. The comparison of the new tracks with the location on the\nHR diagram of pre--MS binariesis not completely satisfactory, as some binary\ncomponents are located at too low \\teff. Besides, the pre--MS lithium depletion\nin the MLT--\\alpha^2D tracks is still much larger than that expected from the\nobservations of lithium in young open clusters. This result is similar to that\nof FST models. Thus, in spite of the fact that 2D RHD models should provide a\nbetter convection description than any local model, their introduction is not\nsufficient to reconcile theory and observations. Lithium depletion in young\nclusters points towards a convection efficiency which, in pre--MS, should be\nsmaller than in the MS. The pre--MS lithium depletion decreases significantly\nin FST models if we reduce the solar metallicity down to the value suggested by\nAsplund et al.(2004), but the corresponding solar model does not reproduce the\ndepth of the convective zone as determined by helioseismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 May 2006 09:17:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Unfortunately, experimental data often do not directly\nreveal structure due to inherent limitations such as imprecision in timing or\nother observation mechanisms. We consider the problem of inferring network\nstructure in the form of a directed graph from co-occurrence observations. Each\nobservation arises from a transmission made over the network and indicates\nwhich vertices carry the transmission without explicitly conveying their order\nin the path. Without order information, there are an exponential number of\nfeasible graphs which agree with the observed data equally well. Yet, the basic\nphysical principles underlying most networks strongly suggest that all feasible\ngraphs are not equally likely. In particular, vertices that co-occur in many\nobservations are probably closely connected. Previous approaches to this\nproblem are based on ad hoc heuristics.

I present a rigorous construction of quantum and classical\nelectrodynamics from fundamental principles of quantum theory. Hilbert space of\ndimension N is justified from statements about measurements with finite range\nand resolution. Using linear combinations of basis kets, a continuum of kets,\n|x> for x in R^3, is constructed such that the inner product can be expressed\nas a finite sum or as an integral. Vectors are smooth wave functions such that\ndifferential operators are defined and the choice of basis has no affect on\nunderlying physics. Quantum field operators, phi(x) for x in R^4, are\nconstructed from creation and annihilation operators on Fock space, obey\nquantum covariance and locality, and are suitable for a description of particle\ninteractions under the Feynman-St\\\"uckelberg interpretation. It is shown that\nthe formulation is consistent and that any dependency on a lattice arises from\nmeasurement, not from underlying physics. In consequence, and because the\ncontinuum is constructed from linear combinations of basis kets, it is not\nrequired to take the limit N-->oo. Quantum fields are defined on a continuum,\nand are operator valued functions, not distributions. The interacting Dirac\nequation, Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz force law are derived, showing\nthat qed is a complete theory of the electromagnetic interaction, not just a\nperturbation theory and that bare mass and charge are the physical values. Up\nto the accuracy of measurement, predictions of perturbation theory are\nidentical to those of standard qed with all loop divergences removed.

Hysteresis is assumed to emerge from the\nintrinsic properties of the cells. We consider the recurrent networks\ncontaining either bistable or multistable neurons. We apply our analysis to the\noculomotor velocity-to-position neural integrator that calculates the eye\npositions from the inputs that carry information about eye angular velocity.\nUsing the analysis of the system in the parameter space we show the following.\nThe direction of hysteresis in the neuronal response may be reversed for the\nsystem with recurrent connections compared to the case of unconnected neurons.\nThus, for the NMDA receptor based bistability the firing rates after ON\nsaccades may be higher than after OFF saccades for the same eye position. We\nsuggest that this is an emergent property due to the presence of global\nrecurrent feedback. The reversal of hysteresis occurs only when the size of\nhysteresis differs from neuron to neuron. We also relate the macroscopic leak\ntime-constant of the integrator to the rate of microscopic spontaneous\nnoise-driven transitions in the hysteretic units.
