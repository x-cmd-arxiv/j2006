Comprehensive tests were performed to\nquantify sample incompleteness, as well as the rate of false positive CIV\nidentifications. The trend of constant $\\Omega_{CIV}(z)$ observed at z~2-5\nappears to continue to z~6, the highest observed redshift. The CIV sample is\nalso consistent with the redshift-invariant form of the CIV column density\ndistribution reported by Songaila (2001) at lower redshift, although with\nfairly large uncertainties due to a smaller sample size and noisier infrared\ndata. The constant value of $\\Omega_{CIV}$ does not necessarily imply that the\nIGM was infused with an early metallicity ``floor,'' but the presence of early\nCIV does indicate that heavy-element enrichment began < 1 Gyr after the Big\nBang. The lack of a decline in $\\Omega_{CIV}$ at high redshift may indicate\nthat integrated CIV measurements are sensitive to the instantaneous rate of\nfeedback from galaxy formation at each epoch. Alternatively, it could result\nfrom a balance in the evolution of the intergalactic gas density, ionization\nconditions, and heavy-element abundance over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2006 16:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We use the light curve and\nspectra fitting of individual SN to estimate the mass of the progenitor,\nexplosion energy, and produced 56Ni mass. Comparison with the abundance\npatterns of EMP stars has made it possible to determine the model parameters of\ncore-collapse SNe, such as mixing-fallback parameters.\n  More specifically, we take into account the two distinct new classes of\nmassive SNe: 1) very energetic Hypernovae, whose kinetic energy (KE) is more\nthan 10 times the KE of normal core-collapse SNe, and 2) very faint and low\nenergy SNe (Faint SNe). These two new classes of SNe are likely to be\n``black-hole-forming'' SNe with rotating or non-rotating black holes.\nNucleosynthesis in Hypernovae is characterized by larger abundance ratios\n(Zn,Co,V,Ti)/Fe and smaller (Mn,Cr)/Fe than normal SNe, which can explain the\nobserved trends of these ratios in EMP stars. Nucleosynthesis in Faint SNe is\ncharacterized by a large amount of fall-back, which explains the abundance\npattern of the most Fe-poor stars. These comparisons suggest that\nblack-hole-forming SNe made important contributions to the early Galactic (and\ncosmic) chemical evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2006 16:16:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-05"}

Two possible boundary conditions are considered: i) a constant\nexternal flux without constrains on the dust temperature, and ii) the maximum\ndust temperature set to the sublimation temperature. We find that the first\ncondition allows small grains to completely suppress the temperature inversion\nof big grains if the overall opacity is dominated by small grains. The second\ncondition enables big grains to maintain the inversion even when they are a\nminor contributor to the opacity. In reality, the choice of boundary condition\ndepends on the dust dynamics. When applied to the physics of protoplanetary\ndisks, the temperature inversion leads to a previously unrecognized disk\nstructure where optically thin dust can exist inside the dust destruction\nradius of an optically thick disk.

In p+p collisions, we investigate the\nrelative contribution of partonic sub-processes to $D$ meson production and $D$\nmeson-triggered inclusive di-hadrons to lowest order in perturbative QCD. While\ngluon fusion dominates the creation of large angle $D\\bar{D}$ pairs, charm on\nlight parton scattering determines the yield of single inclusive $D$ mesons.\nThe distinctly different non-perturbative fragmentation of $c$ quarks into $D$\nmesons versus the fragmentation of quarks and gluons into light hadrons results\nin a strong transverse momentum dependence of anticharm content of the\naway-side charm-triggered jet. In p+A reactions, we calculate and resum the\ncoherent nuclear-enhanced power corrections from the final-state partonic\nscattering in the medium. We find that single and double inclusive open charm\nproduction can be suppressed as much as the yield of neutral pions from\ndynamical high-twist shadowing. Effects of energy loss in p+A collisions are\nalso investigated in the incoherent Bertsch-Gunion limit and may lead to\nsignificantly weaker transverse momentum dependence of the nuclear attenuation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 May 2006 21:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
