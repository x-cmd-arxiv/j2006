In this paper we present a simple model for computing the\ncharacteristic quantities (including energy, temperature, and time-duration)\nfor the transient event from the shock breakout in Type Ibc supernovae produced\nby the core-collapse of WR stars surrounded by dense winds. In contrast to the\ncase of a star without a strong wind, the shock breakout occurs in the wind\nregion rather than inside the star, caused by the large optical depth in the\nwind. We find that, for the case of a WR star with a dense wind, the total\nenergy of the radiation generated by the supernova shock breakout is larger\nthan that in the case of the same star without a wind by a factor > 10. The\ntemperature can be either hotter or cooler, depending on the wind parameters.\nThe time-duration is larger caused by the increase in the effective radius of\nthe star due to the presence of a thick wind. Then, we apply the model to GRB\n060218/SN 2006aj.

In\nparticular, we show that: (i) In the present episode real price increases are,\nat least for now, of the same order of magnitude as in previous episodes,\ntypically of the order of 80 percent to 100 percent. (ii) Historically, price\npeaks turned out to be symmetrical with respect to the peak; soft landing, i.e.\nan upgoing phase followed by a plateau, has rarely (if ever) been observed.\n(iii) The inflated demand is mainly boosted by investors and high-income\nbuyers. (iv) In the present as well as in previous episodes, the main engines\nin the upgoing phase have been the hot markets which developed in major cities\nsuch as London, Los Angeles, New York, Paris, San Francisco or Sydney. In our\nconclusion, we propose a prediction for real estate prices in the West of the\nUnited States over the period 2005-2011.

Thus, PufX is regarded essential for quinone exchange.\n  In contrast to this view, which implicitly treats the LH1s as obstacles to\nphotosynthesis, we propose that the primary purpose of PufX is to improve the\nefficiency of light harvesting by inducing the LH1 dimerization. Calculations\nwith a dipole model, which compare the photosynthetic efficiency of various\nconfigurations of monomeric and dimeric core complexes, show that the dimer can\nabsorb photons directly into the RC about 30% more efficient, when related to\nthe number of bacteriochlorophylls, but that the performance of the more\nsophisticated dimeric LH1 antenna degrades faster with structural\nperturbations. The calculations predict an optimal orientation of the reaction\ncenters relative to the LH1 dimer, which agrees well with the experimentally\nfound configuration.\n  For the increased required rigidity of the dimer additional modifications of\nthe LH1 subunits are necessary, which would lead to the observed ubiquinone\nblockage, when PufX is missing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 May 2006 12:17:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Mar 2007 14:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
