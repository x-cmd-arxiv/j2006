For that to happen, spin-based devices must forsake\nthe transistor paradigm of switching states by physical movement of charges,\nand instead, switch states by flipping spins of stationary charges. An\nembodiment of this approach is the single spin logic idea proposed more than 10\nyears ago. Here, I revisit that idea and present estimates of the switching\nspeed and power dissipation. I show that the Single Spin Switch is far superior\nto the Spin Field Effect Transistor (or any of its clones) in terms of power\ndissipation.
