By solving numerically the hydrodynamic Hall-Vinen-Bekarevich-Khalatnikov\nequations for a rotating superfluid in a differentially rotating spherical\nshell, we find that the meridional counterflow driven by Ekman pumping exceeds\nthe Donnelly-Glaberson threshold throughout most of the outer core, exciting\nunstable Kelvin waves which disrupt the rectilinear vortex array, creating a\nvortex tangle. In the turbulent state, the torque exerted on the crust\noscillates, and the crust-core coupling is weaker than in the laminar state.\nThis leads to a new scenario for the rotational glitches observed in radio\npulsars: a vortex tangle is sustained in the differentially rotating outer core\nby the meridional counterflow, a sudden spin-up event brings the crust and core\ninto corotation, the vortex tangle relaxes back to a rectilinear vortex array,\nthen the crust spins down electromagnetically until enough meridional\ncounterflow builds up to reform a vortex tangle. The turbulent-laminar\ntransition can occur uniformly or in patches; the associated time-scales are\nestimated from vortex filament theory. We calculate numerically the global\nstructure of the flow with and without an inviscid superfluid component, for\nHall-Vinen and Gorter-Mellink forms of the mutual friction.

In this paper, we prove the security of a\nthree-state protocol that does not possess rotational symmetry. The three-state\nQKD protocol we consider involves three qubit states, where the first two\nstates, |0_z> and |1_z>, can contribute to key generation and the third state,\n|+>=(|0_z>+|1_z>)/\\sqrt{2}, is for channel estimation. This protocol has been\nproposed and implemented experimentally in some frequency-based QKD systems\nwhere the three states can be prepared easily. Thus, by founding on the\nsecurity of this three-state protocol, we prove that these QKD schemes are, in\nfact, unconditionally secure against any attacks allowed by quantum mechanics.\nThe main task in our proof is to upper bound the phase error rate of the qubits\ngiven the bit error rates observed. Unconditional security can then be proved\nnot only for the ideal case of a single-photon source and perfect detectors,\nbut also for the realistic case of a phase-randomized weak coherent light\nsource and imperfect threshold detectors. Our result on the phase error rate\nupper bound is independent of the loss in the channel. Also, we compare the\nthree-state protocol with the BB84 protocol.
