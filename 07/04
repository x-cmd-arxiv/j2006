To boost the image quality, the\ndual-gain mode, a successful means for enhancing the dynamic range of the\nflat-panel detectors and obtaining better results in the contrast of the\nreconstructed image, was developed and successfully tested during the last few\nyears. The important steps in the calibration of this mode involve a correction\nto the pulse widths associated with the X-ray production, the assessment of the\ndetector signal above which nonlinear effects become significant and the\ndetermination of some properties of the detector pixels, namely, of dark\nfields, flatness corrections, etc. Finally, the defect-pixel map is obtained,\ncontaining dead and flickering pixels, as well as pixels with properties which\nare sufficiently `out of range'. An effect observed in the offset correction of\nraw images seems to originate in the mismatch between the measured and\nextrapolated values of the dark field; a correction scheme is proposed to take\naccount of this effect. In the data processing, which is achieved on the basis\nof the files produced in the calibration of the mode, the high-gain signal is\nused whenever meaningful; otherwise, it is substituted by the low-gain signal,\nproperly scaled.

In the Lamb-Dicke regime, for tuned or\ndetuned lasers with respect to the internal frequency of the ion, and weak or\nstrong laser intensities, the vibronic transitions occur at well isolated \"Rabi\nResonances\", where the detuning-adapted Rabi frequency coincides with the level\nspacing of the vibrational modes. These vibronic resonances are characterized\nas avoided crossings of the dressed levels (eigenvalues of the full\nHamiltonian). Their peculiarities due to symmetry constraints and trapping\npotential are also examined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2006 17:37:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2006 11:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2006 10:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Such expectation values can be measured by repeatedly preparing |psi>\nand coupling the system to an apparatus. For this method, the precision of the\nmeasured value scales as 1/sqrt(N) for N repetitions of the experiment. For the\nproblem of estimating the parameter phi in an evolution exp(-i phi H), it is\npossible to achieve precision 1/N (the quantum metrology limit) provided that\nsufficient information about H and its spectrum is available. We consider the\nmore general problem of estimating expectations of operators A with minimal\nprior knowledge of A. We give explicit algorithms that approach precision 1/N\ngiven a bound on the eigenvalues of A or on their tail distribution. These\nalgorithms are particularly useful for simulating quantum systems on quantum\ncomputers because they enable efficient measurement of observables and\ncorrelation functions. Our algorithms are based on a method for efficiently\nmeasuring the complex overlap of |psi> and U|psi>, where U is an implementable\nunitary operator. We explicitly consider the issue of confidence levels in\nmeasuring observables and overlaps and show that, as expected, confidence\nlevels can be improved exponentially with linear overhead. We further show that\nthe algorithms given here can typically be parallelized with minimal increase\nin resource usage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2006 20:44:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Using a model of two-level atoms with Ising-type\ninteraction as an example, it is demonstrated that interparticle interaction\ncombined with atom-field coupling can introduce additional interatomic\ncorrelations acting as a phase synchronizing factor. For the case of weakly\ninteracting atoms with $J<\\hbar\\omega_0$, where $J$ is the interparticle\ncoupling constant and $\\omega_0$ is the atomic frequency, dynamical regimes of\ncooperative relaxation of atoms are analyzed in Born-Markov approximation both\nnumerically and using the mean field approximation. We show that interparticle\ncorrelations induced by the direct interaction result in inhibition of\nincoherent spontaneous decay leading to the regime of collective pulse\nrelaxation which differs from superradiance in nature. For superradiant\ntransition, the synchronizing effect of interatomic interaction is found to\nmanifest itself in enhancement of superradiance. When the interaction is strong\nand $J>\\hbar\\omega_0$, one-partice one-photon transitions are excluded and\ntransition to the regime of multiphoton relaxation occurs. Using a simple model\nof two atoms in a high-Q single mode cavity we show that such transition is\naccompanied by Rabi oscillations involving many-atom multiphoton states.\nDephasing effect of dipole-dipole interaction and solitonic mechanism of\nrelaxation are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2006 12:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-21"}
