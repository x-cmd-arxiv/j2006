In particular, the probability for gravitational\narcs in high-redshift clusters is considerably increased, which may offer an\nexplanation for the unexpectedly high lensing efficiency of distant clusters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2006 13:36:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Oct 2006 09:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The details of the rest-frame color distribution depend\nhowever on redshift and on galaxy luminosity: faint galaxies are bluer than the\nluminous ones over the whole redshift range of our data, and galaxies become\nbluer as redshift increases. This blueing trend does not depend, to a first\napproximation, on galaxy luminosity.

The comparison between this spectral classification and the rest-frame\ncolors shows that about 35-40 % of the red objects are star forming galaxies.\nHence we conclude that the red sequence cannot be used to effectively isolate a\nsample of purely passively evolving objects within a cosmological survey.

Transport through the quantum wire is investigated by\nmeans of a noninteracting Anderson tunneling Hamiltonian. Analytical\nexpressions of the transmission probability and phase are given. The\ntransmission probability shows an energy spectrum with forbidden and allowed\nbands that depends on the up-down asymmetry of the system. In up-down symmetry\nonly the gap survives, and in up-down asymmetry an allowed band is formed. We\nshow that the allowed band arises by the indirect coupling between the up and\ndown quantum dots. In addition, the band edges can be controlled by the degree\nof asymmetry of the quantum dots. We discuss the analogy between this\nphenomenon with the Dicke effect in optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2006 19:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

For many years, a similar categorical framework\nhas been lacking for non-abelian (co)homology, the subject of which includes\nthe categories of non-abelian groups, of rings, Lie algebras, etc. The notion\nof semi-abelian category due to Janelidze, Marki and Tholen allows a unified\nstudy of many important homological properties of such categories. For\ninstance, in any semi-abelian category, the classical diagram lemmas (the Short\nFive Lemma, the 3x3 Lemma, the Snake Lemma, Noether's Isomorphism Theorems)\nhold. The point of this thesis is, that the semi-abelian framework is indeed\nperfectly suited for the study of non-abelian (co)homology and the\ncorresponding homotopy theory. It describes the foundations for a categorical\nhomology theory that unifies many basic aspects of the classical (co)homology\ntheories of e.g., groups, Lie algebras and crossed modules. Starting from\nhomology of (proper) chain complexes and of simplicial objects, a semi-abelian\nversion of Barr-Beck cotriple homology is introduced. A systematic study of the\ntheory of Baer invariants in this context yields categorical versions of Hopf's\nformula (describing the second homology object in terms of commutators) and the\nStallings-Stammbach sequence. We obtain a Universal Coefficient Theorem, a\nversion of the Hochschild-Serre sequence, and an interpretation of the second\ncohomology group in terms of isomorphism classes of central extensions. Also,\nQuillen model category structures for homotopy of simplicial objects and\ninternal categories are studied, and are shown to be compatible with the\nrespective semi-abelian notions of homology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jul 2006 17:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Appl. Probab. 14 (2004) 274--325] introduced an\nimportant new technique for lower bounding the mixing time of a Markov chain.\nIn this paper we extend Wilson's technique to find lower bounds of the correct\norder for card shuffling Markov chains where at each time step a random card is\npicked and put at the top of the deck. Two classes of such shuffles are\naddressed, one where the probability that a given card is picked at a given\ntime step depends on its identity, the so-called move-to-front scheme, and one\nwhere it depends on its position. For the move-to-front scheme, a test function\nthat is a combination of several different eigenvectors of the transition\nmatrix is used. A general method for finding and using such a test function,\nunder a natural negative dependence condition, is introduced. It is shown that\nthe correct order of the mixing time is given by the biased coupon collector's\nproblem corresponding to the move-to-front scheme at hand. For the second\nclass, a version of Wilson's technique for complex-valued\neigenvalues/eigenvectors is used. Such variants were presented in [Random Walks\nand Geometry (2004) 515--532] and [Electron. Comm. Probab. 8 (2003) 77--85].\nHere we present another such variant which seems to be the most natural one for\nthis particular class of problems. To find the eigenvalues for the general case\nof the second class of problems is difficult, so we restrict attention to two\nspecial cases. In the first case the card that is moved to the top is picked\nuniformly at random from the bottom $k=k(n)=o(n)$ cards, and we find the lower\nbound $(n^3/(4\\pi^2k(k-1)))\\log n$. Via a coupling, an upper bound exceeding\nthis by only a factor 4 is found. This generalizes Wilson's [Electron. Comm.\nProbab. 8 (2003) 77--85] result on the Rudvalis shuffle and Goel's [Ann. Appl.\nProbab. 16 (2006) 30--55] result on top-to-bottom shuffles. In the second case\nthe card moved to the top is, with probability 1/2, the bottom card and with\nprobability 1/2, the card at position $n-k$. Here the lower bound is again of\norder $(n^3/k^2)\\log n$, but in this case this does not seem to be tight unless\n$k=O(1)$. What the correct order of mixing is in this case is an open question.\nWe show that when $k=n/2$, it is at least $\\Theta(n^2)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2006 12:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The integral relation is crucial to correctly interpret\nnon-single-exponential decay.

In this case, the\nwell-known emission quantum efficiency can not be expressed by a single number\nanymore, but it is also distributed. We derive a practical description of\nnon-single-exponential emission decay curves in terms of a single distribution\nof decay rates; the resulting distribution is identified as the distribution of\ntotal decay rates weighted with the radiative rates.

By temporal differentiation, we mean a division of labor whereby\ndifferent subtasks associated with performing a given task are done at\ndifferent times. The idea is that, by focusing on one particular set of\nsubtasks at a time, it is possible to increase the efficiency with which each\nsubtask is performed, thereby allowing for faster completion of the overall\ntask. For this paper, we consider a process whereby some resource is converted\ninto some final product in a series of three agent-mediated steps. Temporal\ndifferentiation is incorporated by allowing the agents to oscillate between\nperforming the first two steps and performing the last step. We find that\ntemporal differentiation is favored when the number of agents is small, and\nwhen the process intermediates have a much longer lifetime than the original\nresource. Within the framework of biological systems, we argue that these\nresults provide a possible evolutionary basis for the emergence of sleep, and\nalso of distinct REM and non-REM sleep states. We also discuss our use of a\nthree-step model. Briefly, in order for temporal differentiation to increase\nproduct output in a mean-field description of resource metabolism, it is\nnecessary for temporal differentiation to have a nonlinear effect on individual\nprocess rates.
