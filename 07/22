Such assessment is critical not only for establishing the\nrelevance of any individual simulation but also in the extremely active field\nof developing computational methods. Here we map the trajectory assessment\nproblem onto a simple statistical calculation of the ``effective sample size''\n- i.e., the number of statistically independent configurations. The mapping is\nachieved by asking the question, ``How much time must elapse between snapshots\nincluded in a sample for that sample to exhibit the statistical properties\nexpected for independent and identically distributed configurations?'' The\nresulting ``structural de-correlation time'' is robustly calculated using exact\nproperties deduced from our previously developed ``structural histograms,''\nwithout any fitting parameters. We show the method is equally and directly\napplicable to toy models, peptides, and a 72-residue protein model. Variants of\nour approach can readily be applied to a wide range of physical and chemical\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2006 19:16:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Feb 2007 14:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We find three distinct\nregions of scale-invariance, which correspond to the well-known VLF, LF, and HF\nbands in the power spectra of heart rate variability. The scaling exponents\nalpha are alphaHF: 1.15 [0.96-1.22], alphaLF: 0.68 [0.57-0.84], alphaVLF:\n0.83[0.82-0.99]; p<10^-5).
