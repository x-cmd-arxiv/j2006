A set of ten spectrally\ndispersed (8-13 micron) interferometric measurements of HR 5999 was obtained.\nThe characteristic size of the emission region depends on the projected\nbaseline length and position angle, and it ranges between ~ 5-15\nmilliarcseconds (Gauss FWHM), corresponding to remarkably small physical sizes\nof ~ 1-3 AU. To derive constraints on the geometrical distribution of the dust,\nwe compared our interferometric measurements to 2D, frequency-dependent\nradiation transfer simulations of circumstellar disks and envelopes. For disk\nmodels with radial power-law density distributions, the relatively weak but\nvery extended emission from outer disk regions (>~ 3 AU) leads to model\nvisibilities that are significantly lower than the observed visibilities,\nmaking these models inconsistent with the MIDI data.

In this paper, we test this hypothesis in\nmodels of chemical evolution of galaxies of different morphological type:\nellipticals, spirals and irregulars. We show that this proposed scenario is\ncompatible also with the main chemical properties of galaxies. When the new\nrate is introduced in the two-infall model for the Milky Way, the derived Type\nIa SN rate as a function of cosmic time shows a high and broad peak at very\nearly epochs thus influencing the chemical evolution of the galactic halo more\nthan in the previous widely adopted formulations for the SNIa rate. As a\nconsequence of this, the [O/Fe] ratio decreases faster for [Fe/H] > -2.0 dex,\nrelative to the old models. For a typical elliptical of 10^11 M_sun of luminous\nmass, the new rate produces average [alpha/ Fe] ratios in the dominant stellar\npopulation still in agreement with observations. The Type Ia SN rate also in\nthis case shows an earlier peak and a subsequent faster decline relative to the\nprevious results, but the differences are smaller than in the case of our\nGalaxy. We have also checked the effects of the new Type Ia SN rate on the\nevolution of the Fe content in the ICM, as a consequence of its production from\ncluster ellipticals and we found that less Fe in the ICM is produced with the\nnew rate, due to the higher fraction of Fe synthesized at early times and\nremaining locked into the stars in ellipticals. For dwarf irregular galaxies\nsuffering few bursts of star formation we obtain [O/Fe] ratios larger by 0.2\ndex relative to the previous models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2006 15:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The new framework utilizes a\nsingle pair of vector--spinor representation $144+\\bar{144}$ to break the gauge\nsymmetry all the way to $SU(3)_C \\times U(1)_{em}$. Typically the matter--Higgs\ncouplings in this framework are quartic and lead to naturally suppressed Yukawa\ncouplings for the first two generations. Here we show that much larger third\ngeneration couplings naturally arise at the cubic level with additional matter\nin 10--plet and 45--plet representations of SO(10). Thus the physical third\ngeneration is a mixture of 16, 10 and 45--plet representations while the\nremaining components become superheavy and are removed from the low energy\nspectrum. In this scenario it is possible to understand the heaviness of the\ntop in a natural way since the analysis generates a hierarchy in the Yukawa\ncouplings so that $h_{\\textnormal {t}}/h_{\\textnormal {b}}>> 1$ where\n$h_{\\textnormal {t}} (h_{\\textnormal {b}})$ are the top (bottom) Yukawa\ncouplings. It is then possible to realize values of $\\tan\\beta$ as low as 2,\nwhich also helps to stabilize the proton.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 21 Jul 2006 15:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-27"}
