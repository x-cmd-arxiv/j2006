To explain the complex\nmorphology, we first consider a scenario in which the radio structures are the\nresult of superwinds ejected by a nuclear starburst. However, recent Spitzer\nobservations of Mrk 6 provide an upper limit to the star formation rate (SFR)\nof ~5.5 M_sun/yr, an estimate much lower than the SFR of ~33 M_sun/yr derived\nassuming that the bubbles are a result of starburst winds energized by\nsupernovae explosions.

Ultra-cold atom gases have opened an\nexciting laboratory in which to explore many-particle systems that are not\naccessible in conventional atomic or solid state physics. It appears promising\nthat optical trapping of cold bosonic or fermionic atoms will make construction\nof devices with unprecedented precision possible in the future, thereby\nallowing experimenters to make their samples much more \"clean\", and hence more\ncoherent. Trapped atomic quantum gases may thus provide an interesting\nalternative to the quantum dot nanostructures produced today. Optical lattices\ncreated by standing laser waves loaded with ultra-cold atoms are an example of\nthis. They provide a unique experimental setup to study artificial crystal\nstructures with tunable physical parameters. Here we demonstrate that a\ntwo-dimensional optical lattice loaded with repulsive, contact-interacting\nfermions shows a rich and systematic magnetic phase diagram. Trapping a few (N\n=< 12) fermions in each of the single-site minima of the optical lattice, we\nfind that the em shell structure in these quantum wells determines the\nmagnetism. In a shallow lattice, the tunneling between the lattice sites is\nstrong, and the lattice is non-magnetic. For deeper lattices, however, the\nshell-filling of the single wells with fermionic atoms determines the\nmagnetism. As a consequence of Hund's first rule, the interaction energy is\nlowered by maximizing the number of atoms of the same species. This leads to a\nsystematic sequence of non-magnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic\nphases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2006 12:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

In\nparticular, the length of the codewords can be significantly reduced.\n  First we generalize the proofs of the false positive and false negative error\nprobabilities with the following modifications: (1) we replace Tardos'\nhard-coded numbers by variables and (2) we allow for independently chosen false\npositive and false negative error rates. It turns out that all the\ncollusion-resistance properties can still be proven when the code length is\nreduced by a factor of more than 2.\n  Second, we study the statistical properties of the fingerprinting scheme, in\nparticular the average and variance of the accusations. We identify which\ncolluder strategy forces the content owner to employ the longest code. Using a\ngaussian approximation for the probability density functions of the\naccusations, we show that the required false negative and false positive error\nrate can be achieved with codes that are a factor 2 shorter than required for\nrigid proofs.\n  Combining the results of these two approaches, we show that the Tardos scheme\ncan be used with a code length approximately 5 times shorter than in the\noriginal construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2006 15:11:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Jun 2008 09:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-06-03"}
