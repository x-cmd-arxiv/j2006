From\nour sample of ~50 i-drop Lyman-break star-forming galaxies in GOODS-South with\nz'(AB)<27mag, we focus on ~30 with reliable photometric or spectroscopic\nredshifts.

This\nindicates the presence of old underlying stellar populations that dominate the\nstellar masses. For these objects, we find ages of 200-700Myr, implying\nformation redshifts of 7<z<14, and large stellar masses in the range\n1-3x10^10M_sun. Analysis of 7 i-drops that are undetected at 3.6microns\nindicates that these are younger, considerably less massive systems. We\ncalculate that line contamination should not severely affect our photometry or\nderived results. Using data out to 8microns, we find little evidence for\nsubstantial intrinsic dust reddening.

This entropy preservation property has been\nwell-utilized to establish non-trivial properties of discrete stochastic\nprocesses, e.g. queuing process \\cite{prg03}. Entropy as well as entropy\npreservation is well-defined only in the context of purely discrete or\ncontinuous random variables. However for a mixture of discrete and continuous\nrandom variables, which arise in many interesting situations, the notions of\nentropy and entropy preservation have not been well understood.\n  In this paper, we extend the notion of entropy in a natural manner for a\nmixed-pair random variable, a pair of random variables with one discrete and\nthe other continuous. Our extensions are consistent with the existing\ndefinitions of entropy in the sense that there exist natural injections from\ndiscrete or continuous random variables into mixed-pair random variables such\nthat their entropy remains the same. This extension of entropy allows us to\nobtain sufficient conditions for entropy preservation in mixtures of discrete\nand continuous random variables under bijections.\n  The extended definition of entropy leads to an entropy rate for continuous\ntime Markov chains.
