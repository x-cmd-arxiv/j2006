However, many stellar population models are still relatively\npoorly calibrated in this part of the spectrum. To allow an improvement of this\ncalibration we present a new database of integrated near-infrared JHKs\nmagnitudes for 75 star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds, using the 2-Micron\nAll-Sky Survey (2MASS). The majority of the clusters in our sample have robust\nage and metallicity estimates from color-magnitude diagrams available in the\nliterature, and populate a range of ages from 10 Myr to 15 Gyr and a range in\n[Fe/H] from -2.17 to +0.01 dex. A comparison with matched star clusters in the\n2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC) reveals that the XSC only provides a good\nfit to the unresolved component of the cluster stellar population. We also\ncompare our results with the often-cited single-channel JHK photometry of\nPersson and collaborators, and find significant differences, especially for\ntheir 30\"-diameter apertures up to ~2.5 mag in the K-band, more than 1 mag in\nJ-K, and up to 0.5 mag in H-K. Using simulations to center apertures based on\nmaximum light throughput (as performed by Persson et al, we show that these\ndifferences can be attributed to near-IR-bright cluster stars (e.g., Carbon\nstars) located away from the true center of the star clusters. The wide age and\nmetallicity coverage of our integrated JHKs photometry sample constitutes a\nfundamental dataset for testing population synthesis model predictions, and for\ndirect comparison with near-IR observations of distant stellar populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2006 17:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

From the multi-frequency observations\npresented in a recent study (Mittal et al. 2006) and several previous\nobservations made by other authors, the anomaly is well-established in that the\nimage flux-density ratio (A/B) decreases from 3.9 to 2.0 over the observed\nfrequency range from 15 GHz to 1.65 GHz. In Mittal et al. (2006), the authors\ninvestigated whether an interplay between a frequency-dependent structure of\nthe background radio-source and a gradient in the relative image-magnification\ncan explain away the anomaly. Insufficient shifts in the image centroids with\nfrequency led them to discard the above effect as the cause of the anomaly. In\nthis paper, we first take this analysis further by evaluating the combined\neffect of the background source extension and magnification gradients in the\nlens plane in more detail. This is done by making a direct use of the observed\nVLBI flux-distributions for each image to estimate the image flux-density\nratios at different frequencies from a lens-model. As a result of this\ninvestigation, this mechanism does not account for the anomaly. Following this,\nwe analyze the effects of mechanisms which are non-gravitational in nature on\nthe image flux ratios in B0218+357. These are free-free absorption and\nscattering, and are assumed to occur under the hypothesis of a molecular cloud\nresiding in the lens galaxy along the line-of-sight to image A. We show that\nfree-free absorption due to an H II region covering the entire structure of\nimage A at 1.65 GHz can explain the image flux ratio anomaly. We also discuss\nwhether H II regions with physical parameters as derived from our analysis are\nconsistent with those observed in Galactic and extragalactic H II regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2006 18:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

However, the lognormal optical depth distribution fits the data at\nall redshifts with only minor continuum adjustments. We use a simple\nparametrization for the evolution of the lognormal parameters to calculate the\nexpected mean transmitted flux at z > 5.4. The lognormal optical depth\ndistribution predicts the observed Ly-alpha and Ly-beta effective optical\ndepths at z > 5.7 while simultaneously fitting the mean transmitted flux down\nto z = 1.6.

The research presented here is intended to be a\nstep towards this vision. We describe a computational simulation of nanoscale\nmachines floating in a virtual liquid. The machines can bond together to form\nstrands (chains) that self-replicate and self-assemble into user-specified\nmeshes. There are four types of machines and the sequence of machine types in a\nstrand determines the shape of the mesh they will build. A strand may be in an\nunfolded state, in which the bonds are straight, or in a folded state, in which\nthe bond angles depend on the types of machines. By choosing the sequence of\nmachine types in a strand, the user can specify a variety of polygonal shapes.\nA simulation typically begins with an initial unfolded seed strand in a soup of\nunbonded machines. The seed strand replicates by bonding with free machines in\nthe soup. The child strands fold into the encoded polygonal shape, and then the\npolygons drift together and bond to form a mesh. We demonstrate that a variety\nof polygonal meshes can be manufactured in the simulation, by simply changing\nthe sequence of machine types in the seed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2006 17:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

The main tool that we use is lattice QCD. We concentrated our\nefforts on the study of the main correlators of the pure Yang - Mills theory in\nthe Landau gauge, namely the ghost and the gluon propagators. We are\nparticularly interested in determining the $\\Lqcd$ parameter. It is extracted\nby means of perturbative predictions available up to NNNLO. The related topic\nis the influence of non-perturbative effects that show up as appearance of\npower-corrections to the low-momentum behaviour of the Green functions. A new\nmethod of removing these power corrections allows a better estimate of $\\Lqcd$.\nOur result is $\\Lambda^{n_f=0}_{\\ms} = 269(5)^{+12}_{-9}$ MeV. Another question\nthat we address is the infrared behaviour of Green functions, at momenta of\norder and below $\\Lqcd$. At low energy the momentum dependence of the\npropagators changes considerably, and this is probably related to confinement.\nThe lattice approach allows to check the predictions of analytical methods\nbecause it gives access to non-perturbative correlators. According to our\nanalysis the gluon propagator is finite and non-zero at vanishing momentum, and\nthe power-law behaviour of the ghost propagator is the same as in the free\ncase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2006 19:19:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2006 08:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this communication we derive\nthe unitarity rules for the multiplicity of excited nucleons, alias cut\npomerons, alias topological cross sections, for typical hard dijet production\nprocesses. We demonstrate how the coupled-channel non-Abelian intranuclear\nevolution of color dipoles, inherent to pQCD, gives rise to the reggeon field\ntheory diagrams for final states in terms of the uncut, and two kinds of cut,\npomerons. Upon the proper identification of the uncut and cut pomeron\nexchanges, the topological cross sections for dijet production follow in a\nstraightforward way from the earlier derived nonlinear k_t - factorization\nquadratures for the inclusive dijet cross sections. The concept of a coherent\n(collective) nuclear glue proves extremely useful for the formulation of\nreggeon field theory vertices of multipomeron - cut and uncut - couplings to\nparticles and between themselves.

We employ a minimal modification of the original\nsetup, introducing a dilaton potential. Two types of potential are\ninvestigated: exponential and double-well potentials. For the first type, the\nbasic evolutions of universe and dilaton are such that both the radius of the\nuniverse and the dilaton asymptotically grow in over a short time, or that the\nradius converges to a constant value while the dilaton rolls down toward the\nweak coupling limit. For the second type, in addition to the above solutions,\nthere is another solution in which the dilaton is stabilized at a minimum of\npotential and the radius grows in proportion to $t$. Thermal equilibrium is\nrealized for both cases during the initial phase. These simple setups provide\npossible resolutions of the difficulty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2006 03:47:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2006 01:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

It is understood from the mean-field results for 68Ni that the\nshell gap at N=40 disappears due to dynamical correlations of the isovector J=0\npairing interaction. In 90Zr, however, such a dynamic process with the J=0\npairing appears not important because of the strong contribution of the J>0\ninteraction. We study also level schemes in the Ni isotopes and N=50 isotones.\nWe predict a new band built on the $0_{2}^{+}$ state in both 68Ni and 90Zr. The\nstates of this band are dominated by two-particle-two-hole excitations from the\nfp-shell to the intruder g_{9/2} orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2006 02:44:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2006 05:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
