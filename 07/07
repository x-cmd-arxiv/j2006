The burst mode begins\nupon the formation of a centrifugally balanced disk around a newly formed\nprotostar. It is comprised of prolonged quiescent periods of low accretion rate\n(typically $\\la 10^{-7} \\Msun$ yr$^{-1}$) which are punctuated by intense\nbursts of accretion (typically $\\ga 10^{-4} \\Msun$ yr$^{-1}$, with duration\n$\\la 100$ yr) during which most of the protostellar mass is accumulated. The\naccretion bursts are associated with the formation of dense\nprotostellar/protoplanetary embryos, which are later driven onto the protostar\nby the gravitational torques that develop in the disk. Gravitational\ninstability in the disk, driven by continuing infall from the envelope, is\nshown to be an effective means of transporting angular momentum outward, and\nmass inward to the protostar. We show that the disk mass always remains\nsignificantly less than the central protostar mass throughout this process.

The dynamics of those states depends on the\ninternal relaxation time between bright and dark states (spin-flip time), and\non the radiative recombination time of the bright states. On the other hand,\nthe calculated values of these recombination times depend not only on the\ntreatment of correlation effects, but also on the accuracy of the electron and\nhole wavefunctions. We calculate the radiative decay rates for monoexcitons and\nbiexcitons in (In,As)Ga/GaAs self-assembled and colloidal CdSe quantum dots\nfrom atomistic correlated wave functions. We show how the radiative decay time\ntau_R(X^0) of the monoexciton depends on the spin-flip relaxation time between\nbright and dark states. In contrast, a biexciton has no bright-dark splitting,\nso the decay time of the biexciton tau_R(XX^0) is insensitive to this spin-flip\ntime. This results in ratios $\\tau_R(X^0)/\\tau_R(XX^0)$ of 4 in the case of\nfast spin flip, and a ratio of 2 in the case of slow spin flip.

The problem has a very rich history and is well\ndocumented in the literature. Of course, at first glance, one suspects that the\ntwo dimensional case should be well known.

However, empirical observations of the\nevents leading up to such market phases, as well events occurring during the\nlifetime of such a phase, have often failed to find significant correlation\nbetween news from outside the market and the behavior of the agents comprising\nthe market.

Internal dynamics of the atom is governed by\nthe laser field which is treated to be classical with a large number of\nphotons. Center-of-mass classical atomic motion is governed by the optical\npotential and the internal atomic degree of freedom. The resulting\nHamilton-Schr\\\"odinger equations of motion are a five-dimensional nonlinear\ndynamical system with two integrals of motion. The main focus of the paper is\nchaotic atomic motion that may be quantified strictly by positive values of the\nmaximal Lyapunov exponent. It is shown that atom, depending on the value of its\ntotal energy, can either oscillate chaotically in a well of the optical\npotential or fly ballistically with weak chaotic oscillations of its momentum\nor wander in the optical lattice changing the direction of motion in a chaotic\nway.
