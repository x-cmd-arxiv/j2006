In addition, we present an optical spectrum from Keck LRIS\nfrom which we measure the redshift of the burst, z=0.6528. At this redshift the\nisotropic-equivalent prompt energy release was about 10^51 erg, and using a\nstandard afterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy\nis a factor of 10 larger, E_K,iso ~ 10^52 erg.

The\nsecond picture instead introduces an elongated hybridized phase, called S-DNA,\nstructurally and thermodynamically distinct from standard B-DNA. Little\nthermodynamic evidence exists to discriminate directly between these competing\npictures.

The form of the equations is expected to be valid for a large\nclass of ionic models but the coefficients are only derived analytically for a\ntwo-variable ionic model and calculated numerically for the original Noble\nmodel of Purkinje fiber action potential.In paced tissue, the main result is\nthe existence of a linear instability that produces a periodic pattern of\ndiscordant alternans. Moreover, the patterns of alternans can be either\nstationary, with fixed nodes, or travelling, with moving nodes and hence\nquasiperiodic oscillations of action potential duration, depending on the\nrelative strength of the destabilizing effect of CV-restitution and the\nstabilizing effect of diffusive coupling.
