The\nalgebra \\mbox{{\\cal A}}, when suitably represented in a bundle of Hilbert\nspaces, is a von Neumann algebra \\mathcal{M} of random operators representing\nthe quantum sector of the model. The Tomita-Takesaki theorem allows us to\ndefine the dynamics of random operators which depends on the state \\phi . The\nsame state defines the noncommutative probability measure (in the sense of\nVoiculescu's free probability theory). Moreover, the state \\phi satisfies the\nKubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) condition, and can be interpreted as describing a\ngeneralized equilibrium state. By suitably averaging elements of the algebra\n\\mbox{{\\cal A}}, one recovers the standard geometry of spacetime. We show that\nany act of measurement, performed at a given spacetime point, makes the model\nto collapse to the standard quantum mechanics (on the group G). As an example\nwe compute the noncommutative version of the closed Friedman world model.\nGeneralized eigenvalues of the Einstein operator produce the correct components\nof the energy-momentum tensor. Dynamics of random operators does not ``feel''\nsingularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jul 2006 08:44:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 2007 17:40:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A standard argument reduces the study of the deformations of $N_{16}$\nto the study of the moduli space of pairs $(C,L)$ consisting of a plane quintic\ncurve and a line. We construct this moduli space in two ways: via the periods\nof $K3$ surfaces and by using geometric invariant theory (GIT). The GIT\nconstruction depends on the choice of the linearization. In particular, for one\nchoice of linearization we recover the space constructed via $K3$ surfaces and\nfor another we obtain the full deformation space of $N_{16}$. The two spaces\nare related by a series of explicit flips. In conclusion, by using the\nflexibility given by GIT and the standard tools of Hodge theory, we obtain a\ngood understanding of the deformations of $N_{16}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2006 22:36:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2007 15:34:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-28"}

In this\npaper, we investigate this model on the so-called homogeneous small-world\nnetworks and focus on the influence of the triangular topology on the dynamics.\nOf all the topological quantities, the clustering coefficient is found to play\na significant role in the dynamics of the Naming Game. On the one hand, it\naffects the maximum memory of each agent; on the other hand, it inhibits the\ngrowing of clusters in which agents share a common word, i.e., a larger\nclustering coefficient will cause a slower convergence of the system. We also\nfind a quantitative relationship between clustering coefficient and the maximum\nmemory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2006 20:07:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Oct 2006 14:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We present a simple method that can guide\nmanagement efforts to prevent crashes, peaks, or any other undesirable state.\nAt the same time, the irregularity of the dynamics can be preserved when chaos\nis desirable for the population. The control scheme is easy to implement\nbecause it relies on time series information only.
