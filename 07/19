I find that: (i)\nThe maximum rms amplitudes of the lower and the upper kHz QPO, $r^{\\ell}_{\\rm\nmax}$ and $r^{\\rm u}_{\\rm max}$, respectively, decrease more or less\nexponentially with increasing luminosity of the source; (ii) the maximum\ncoherence of the lower kHz QPO, $Q^{\\ell}_{\\rm max}$, first increases and then\ndecreases exponentially with luminosity, at a faster rate than both\n$r^{\\ell}_{\\rm max}$ and $r^{\\rm u}_{\\rm max}$; (iii) the maximum coherence of\nthe upper kHz QPO, $Q^{\\rm u}_{\\rm max}$, is more or less independent of\nluminosity; and (iv) $r_{\\rm max}$ and $Q_{\\rm max}$ show the opposite\nbehaviour with hardness of the source, consistent with the fact that there is a\ngeneral anticorrelation between luminosity and spectral hardness in these\nsources. Both $r_{\\rm max}$ and $Q_{\\rm max}$ in the sample of sources, and the\nrms amplitude and coherence of the kHz QPOs in individual sources show a\nsimilar behaviour with hardness. This similarity argues against the\ninterpretation that the drop of coherence and rms amplitude of the lower kHz\nQPO at high QPO frequencies in individual sources is a signature of the\ninnermost stable circular orbit around a neutron star. I discuss possible\ninterpretations of these results in terms of the modulation mechanisms that may\nbe responsible for the observed variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2006 23:56:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In contrast, the valley\nsplitting for a finite substrate tilt angle exhibits a strong and\nnon-monotonous dependence on the magnetic field strength. The valley splitting\nof the first Landau level shows an exponential increase followed by a slow\nsaturation as the magnetic field strength increases.

The\nnon-monotonous dependence is explained by the phase variation of the Landau\nlevel wave function along the washboard-like interface between the tilted\nquantum well and the buffer material.

An example of such a system, modeled\nwith dissipative particle dynamics, is presented here. This article\ndemonstrates how a simple coupling between a precursor molecule and surfactant\nmolecules forming micelles can experience a growth-division cycle in a\npredictable manner, and analyzes the influence of crucial parameters on this\nreplication cycle.

The nonlinear character of catalytic reactions, which underlie\nprotein signal transduction cascades, renders stochastic signaling dynamics in\ncytosol biochemical networks distinct from the usual description of stochastic\ndynamics in gene regulatory networks. For a simple 2-step enzymatic cascade\nwhich underlies many important protein signaling pathways, we demonstrated that\nthe commonly used techniques such as the linear noise approximation and the\nLangevin equation become inadequate when the number of proteins becomes too\nlow. Consequently, we developed a new analytical approximation, based on mixing\nthe generating function and distribution function approaches, to the solution\nof the master equation that describes nonlinear chemical signaling kinetics for\nthis important class of biochemical reactions. Our techniques work in a much\nwider range of protein number fluctuations than the methods used previously. We\nfound that under certain conditions the burst-phase noise may be injected into\nthe downstream signaling network dynamics, resulting possibly in unusually\nlarge macroscopic fluctuations. In addition to computing first and second\nmoments, which is the goal of commonly used analytical techniques, our new\napproach provides the full time-dependent probability distributions of the\ncolored non-Gaussian processes in a nonlinear signal transduction cascade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2006 06:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
