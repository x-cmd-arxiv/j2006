Our observations span the restframe optical\nrange containing nebular emission lines such as H_beta, [OIII], and [OII],\nwhich are essential for making robust diagnostics of the physical properties of\nthese ULIRGs. Using the H_alpha/H_beta emission line ratios, we derive internal\nextinction estimates for these galaxies similar to those of local\nULIRGs:A_v~2.9+-0.5. Correcting the H_alpha estimates of the star formation\nrate for dust extinction using the Balmer decrement, results in rates which are\nconsistent with those estimated from the far-infrared luminosity. The majority\n(>60%) of our sample show spectral features characteristic of AGN, with ~65%\nexhibiting broad Balmer emission lines. A proportion of these sources show\nrelatively low [OIII]/H_beta line ratios, which are similar to those of Narrow\nLine Seyfert 1 galaxies suggesting small mass black holes which are rapidly\ngrowing. In the subsample of our survey with both [OIII] and hard X-ray\ncoverage, at least ~60% show an excess of [OIII] emission, by a factor of 5-10\ntimes, relative to the hard X-ray luminosity compared to the correlation\nbetween these two properties seen in Seyferts and QSOs locally. From our\nspectral diagnostics, we propose that the strong [OIII] emission in these\ngalaxies arises from shocks in dense gaseous regions in this vigorously\nstar-forming population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2006 03:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The efficiency of this proposal is demonstrated using some\nmeasure of decorrelation in path space. We also discuss a switching strategy\nthat allows to transform ensemble of paths at a finite rate while remaining at\nequilibrium, in contrast with the usual Jarzynski like switching. This\nswitching is very interesting to sample constrained paths starting from\nunconstrained paths, or to perform simulated annealing in a rigorous way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2006 17:13:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Nov 2006 10:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In the case of a deep middle well, it reduces to a\ndoubly-humped-barrier counterpart of the Kramers escape rate: the barrier\nheight and the curvature of an initial well in the Kramers rate are replaced by\nthe arithmetic mean of higher(or outer) and lower(or inner) partial barriers\nand the geometric mean of curvatures of the initial and intermediate wells,\nrespectively. It seems to be a universal formula. In the case of a\nshallow-enough middle well, Kramers escape rate is alternatively evaluated\nwithin the standard framework of the mean-first-passage time problem, which\ncertainly supports the WKB result. The criteria whether or not the existence of\nan intermediate state can enhance the decay rate are revealed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2006 09:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

When search queries arrive, the bids are used to rank the ads\nlinearly on the search result page. The advertisers pay for each user who\nclicks on their ad, and the amount charged depends on the bids of all the\nadvertisers participating in the auction. In order to be effective, advertisers\nseek to be as high on the list as their budget permits, subject to the market.\n  We study the problem of ranking ads and associated pricing mechanisms when\nthe advertisers not only specify a bid, but additionally express their\npreference for positions in the list of ads.

In this paper, we argue that the naive\napproach to this problem is doomed to failure because, unlike matrices, tensors\nof order 3 or higher can fail to have best rank-r approximations. The\nphenomenon is much more widespread than one might suspect: examples of this\nfailure can be constructed over a wide range of dimensions, orders and ranks,\nregardless of the choice of norm (or even Bregman divergence). Moreover, we\nshow that in many instances these counterexamples have positive volume: they\ncannot be regarded as isolated phenomena. In one extreme case, we exhibit a\ntensor space in which no rank-3 tensor has an optimal rank-2 approximation. The\nnotable exceptions to this misbehavior are rank-1 tensors and order-2 tensors.\nIn a more positive spirit, we propose a natural way of overcoming the\nill-posedness of the low-rank approximation problem, by using weak solutions\nwhen true solutions do not exist.

For risk\nmanagement, knowledge of the entire RND provides more information for\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) calculations than implied volatility alone [1]. Typically,\nRNDs are deduced from option prices by making a distributional assumption, or\nrelying on implied volatility [2]. We present a fully non-parametric method for\nextracting RNDs from observed option prices. The aim is to obtain a continuous,\nsmooth, monotonic, and convex pricing function that is twice differentiable.\nThus, irregularities such as negative probabilities that afflict many existing\nRND estimation techniques are reduced. Our method employs neural networks to\nobtain a smoothed pricing function, and a central finite difference\napproximation to the second derivative to extract the required gradients.\n  This novel technique was successfully applied to a large set of FTSE 100\ndaily European exercise (ESX) put options data and as an Ansatz to the\ncorresponding set of American exercise (SEI) put options. The results of paired\nt-tests showed significant differences between RNDs extracted from ESX and SEI\noption data, reflecting the distorting impact of early exercise possibility for\nthe latter. In particular, the results for skewness and kurtosis suggested\ndifferent shapes for the RNDs implied by the two types of put options. However,\nboth ESX and SEI data gave an unbiased estimate of the realised FTSE 100\nclosing prices on the options' expiration date.

It has a form essentially different from the Tikhonov\nfast-slow form assumed in standard asymptotic reductions of excitable systems.\nThis is of interest since the standard approaches have been previously found\ninadequate to describe phenomena such as the dissipation of cardiac wave fronts\nand the shape of action potential at repolarization. The proposed asymptotic\ndescription overcomes these deficiencies by allowing, among other non-Tikhonov\nfeatures, that a dynamical variable may change its character from fast to slow\nwithin a single solution. The general asymptotic approach is best demonstrated\non an example which should be both simple and generic. The classical model of\nPurkinje fibers (Noble, 1962) has the simplest functional form of all cardiac\nmodels but according to the current understanding it assigns a physiologically\nincorrect role to the Na current. This leads us to suggest an ``Archetypal\nModel'' with the simplicity of the Noble model but with a structure more\ntypical to contemporary cardiac models. We demonstrate that the Archetypal\nModel admits a complete asymptotic solution in quadratures. To validate our\nasymptotic approach, we proceed to consider an exactly solvable ``caricature''\nof the Archetypal Model and demonstrate that the asymptotic of its exact\nsolution coincides with the solutions obtained by substituting the\n``caricature'' right-hand sides into the asymptotic solution of the generic\nArchetypal Model.

Moreover it is also the\nbasis for emerging technologies of quantum information processing such as\nquantum cryptography, quantum teleportation and quantum computation. Bell's\ndiscovery, that correlations measured on entangled quantum systems are at\nvariance with a local realistic picture led to a flurry of experiments\nconfirming the quantum predictions. However, it is still experimentally\nundecided whether quantum entanglement can survive global distances, as\npredicted by quantum theory. Here we report the violation of the\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality measured by two observers\nseparated by 144 km between the Canary Islands of La Palma and Tenerife via an\noptical free-space link using the Optical Ground Station (OGS) of the European\nSpace Agency (ESA). Furthermore we used the entangled pairs to generate a\nquantum cryptographic key under experimental conditions and constraints\ncharacteristic for a Space-to-ground experiment. The distance in our experiment\nexceeds all previous free-space experiments by more than one order of magnitude\nand exploits the limit for ground-based free-space communication; significantly\nlonger distances can only be reached using air- or space-based platforms. The\nrange achieved thereby demonstrates the feasibility of quantum communication in\nspace, involving satellites or the International Space Station (ISS).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2006 14:29:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jul 2006 07:47:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-30"}
