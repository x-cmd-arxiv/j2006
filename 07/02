We\ndetect 117 X-ray sources, of which ~50-60 are likely members of the young open\ncluster Trumpler~37 dispersed throughout the HII region, and 25 are associated\nwith young stars formed within the globule. Spitzer/2MASS photometry shows the\nX-ray population is very young: 3 older Class III stars, 16 classical T Tauri\nstars, 6 protostars including a Class 0/I system. We infer a total T Tauri\npopulation of ~30 stars in the globule, including the undetected population,\nwith a star formation efficiency of 1-4%. An elongated source spatial\ndistribution with an age gradient oriented towards the exciting star is\ndiscovered in the X-ray population of IC 1396N, supporting similar findings in\nother cometary globules. The geometric and age distribution is consistent with\nthe RDI model for triggered star formation in CGs by HII region shocks. The\ninferred velocity of the shock front propagating into the globule is ~0.6km/s.\nThe large number of X-ray-luminous protostars in the globule suggests either an\nunusually high ratio of Class I/0 vs. Class II/III stars, or a non-standard IMF\nfavoring higher mass stars by the triggering process. The Chandra source\nassociated with the luminous Class 0/I protostar IRAS 21391+5802 is one of the\nyoungest stars ever detected in the X-ray band. We also establish for the first\ntime that the X-ray absorption in protostars arises from the local infalling\nenvelopes rather than ambient molecular cloud material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 1 Jul 2006 17:15:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2006 17:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

For the first time, a\nmodel derived strictly from physics is proposed to show that the flow\ninstability under finite amplitude disturbance leads to turbulent transition.\nThe proposed model is named as \"energy gradient method.\" It is demonstrated\nthat it is the transverse energy gradient that leads to the disturbance\namplification while the disturbance is damped by the energy loss due to\nviscosity along the streamline. It is also shown that the threshold of\ndisturbance amplitude obtained is scaled with the Reynolds number by an\nexponent of -1, which exactly explains the recent modern experimental results\nby Hof et al. for pipe flow. The mechanism for velocity inflection and hairpin\nvortex formation are explained with reference to analytical results. Following\nfrom this analysis, it can be demonstrated that the critical value of the so\ncalled energy gradient parameter Kmax is constant for turbulent transition in\nwall bounded parallel flows, and this is confirmed by experiments and is about\n370-389. The location of instability initiation in the flow field accords well\nwith the experiments for both pipe Poiseuille flow (r/R=0.58) and plane\nPoiseuille flow (y/h=0.58). It is also inferred from the proposed method that\nthe transverse energy gradient can serve as the power for the self-sustaining\nprocess of wall bounded turbulence. Finally, the relation of \"energy gradient\nmethod\" to the classical \"energy method\" based on Rayleigh-Orr equation is\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jul 2006 14:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Oct 2006 14:03:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 2007 09:00:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 Nov 2008 06:29:00 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 19 Jun 2018 02:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2018-06-20"}
