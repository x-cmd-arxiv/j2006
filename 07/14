The generalized curvature is also shown to contain the\nsupergravity equations of motion, even in the non-vanishing gravitino case.

In both cases, the time delays modify the drift momenta obtained\nby the $N$ electrons when they reach the continuum at $t+\\Delta t$, by moving\nsuch times towards or away from a crossing of the electric field. The\ncontributions from both types of collisions are influenced in distinct ways,\nand the interplay between such trends determines the widths and the peak\nmomenta of the distributions.
