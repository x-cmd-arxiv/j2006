Long term observations of several\nsystems revealed the periodicity of this variability, synchronized with the\norbital movement. Several partially successful models have been proposed to\nreproduce the observed data. The most promising assume that the origin of the\nemission is the wind-wind interaction zone. In this scenario, two high velocity\nand dense winds produce a strong shock layer, responsible for most of the\nX-rays observed from these systems. As the secondary star moves along its\norbital path, the shock region of conical shape, changes its position with\nrelation to the line of sight.

Recent work on the subject relies on the use of\nsingle photonic qubits in the measurement process. These schemes can be made\nrobust to detector loss, spontaneous emission and cavity mismatching but as a\nconsequence the overhead costs grow rapidly, in particular when considering\nsingle photon loss. In contrast, our approach uses continuous variables and\nhighly efficient homodyne measurements. We present a two-qubit scheme, with a\nsimple bucket measurement system yielding an entangling operation with success\nprobability 1/2. Then we extend this to a three-qubit interaction, increasing\nthis probability to 3/4. We discuss the important issues of the overhead cost\nand the time scaling. This leads to a \"no-measurement\" approach to building\ncluster states, making use of geometric phases in phase space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2006 13:10:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Apr 2007 02:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The structure of\nthe states is very simple and similar to the one of isotropic states: they are\na mixture of a separable and a pure entangled state whose supports are\northogonal. Despite such simple structure, in an opportune interval of the\nmixing parameter their entanglement is not revealed by partial transposition\nnor by the realignment criterion, i.e. by any permutational criterion in the\nbipartite setting. In the range in which the states are Positive under Partial\nTransposition (PPT), they are not distillable; on the other hand, the states in\nthe considered class are provably distillable as soon as they are Nonpositive\nunder Partial Transposition (NPT). The states are associated to any set of more\nthan two pure states. The analysis is extended to the multipartite setting. By\nan opportune selection of the set of multipartite pure states, it is possible\nto construct mixed states which are PPT with respect to any choice of bipartite\ncuts and nevertheless exhibit genuine multipartite entanglement.
