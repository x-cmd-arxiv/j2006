The\ndetected level of continuum flux in 0943-242 is consistent with stellar\nionization. If the MBR is responsible for the ionization of the radio galaxy\nabsorbing shells, their radii (if spherical) would be large (> 100 kpc) and\ntheir mass would be huge (>1E12 M_Sun), implying that a feedback event within\nthe radiogalaxy has expelled more baryonic material than left within it. If, as\nwe believe more likely, stellar sources within the radiogalaxy are responsible\nfor the absorber's ionization, smaller radii of ~25 kpc and much smaller masses\n(~1E8-1E10 M_Sun) are inferred. This radius is consistent with the observed\ntransition in radio source size between smaller sources where strong HI\nabsorption is almost ubiquitous, and the larger sources where it is mostly\nlacking. Finally, we outline additional absorption line diagnostics which could\nfurther constrain the properties of the haloes and their ionization sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2006 11:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A `program' for growing a desired\nstructure consists of a set of molecular `tiles' designed to have specific\nbinding interactions. A key challenge to making algorithmic self-assembly\npractical is designing tile set programs that make assembly robust to errors\nthat occur during initiation and growth. One method for the controlled\ninitiation of assembly, often seen in biology, is the use of a seed or catalyst\nmolecule that reduces an otherwise large kinetic barrier to nucleation. Here we\nshow how to program algorithmic self-assembly similarly, such that seeded\nassembly proceeds quickly but there is an arbitrarily large kinetic barrier to\nunseeded growth. We demonstrate this technique by introducing a family of tile\nsets for which we rigorously prove that, under the right physical conditions,\nlinearly increasing the size of the tile set exponentially reduces the rate of\nspurious nucleation. Simulations of these `zig-zag' tile sets suggest that\nunder plausible experimental conditions, it is possible to grow large seeded\ncrystals in just a few hours such that less than 1 percent of crystals are\nspuriously nucleated. Simulation results also suggest that zig-zag tile sets\ncould be used for detection of single DNA strands. Together with prior work\nshowing that tile sets can be made robust to errors during properly initiated\ngrowth, this work demonstrates that growth of objects via algorithmic\nself-assembly can proceed both efficiently and with an arbitrarily low error\nrate, even in a model where local growth rules are probabilistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jul 2006 05:32:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2010 19:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-01-08"}

Quantum induced superluminal velocities are well-known\nexamples of this effect. The issue of the causal behavior of such propagations\nis somewhat controversial in the literature and we intend to clarify it. We\nprovide a careful analysis of the meaning of causality in classical\nrelativistic field theories, and we stress the role played by the Cauchy\nproblem and the notions of chronology and time arrow. We show that superluminal\nbehavior threaten causality only if a prior chronology on spacetime is chosen.\nIn the case where superluminal propagations occur, however, there is at least\ntwo non conformally related metrics on spacetime and thus two available notions\nof chronology. These two chronologies are on equal footing and it would thus be\nmisleading to choose \\textit{ab initio} one of them to define causality.\nRather, we provide a formulation of causality in which no prior chronology is\nassumed. We argue this is the only way to deal with the issue of causality in\nthe case where some degrees of freedom propagate faster than others. We\nactually show that superluminal propagations do not threaten causality. As an\nillustration of these conceptual issues, we consider two field theories, namely\nk-essences scalar fields and bimetric theories of gravity, and we derive the\nconditions imposed by causality.

Time of flight measurement from different\nastronomical sources set current limits on the energy scale of possible LIV to\n$> 0.01 M_{pl}$ (for n=1 models) and $> 10^{-9} M_{pl}$ (for n=2). According to\ncurrent models Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are accompanied by bursts of high energy\n($\\gsim 100$TeV) neutrinos. At this energy range the background level of\ncurrently constructed neutrino detectors is so low that a detection of a single\nneutrino from the direction of a GRB months or even years after the burst would\nimply an association of the neutrino with the burst and will establish a\nmeasurement of a time of flight delay. Such time of flight measurements provide\nthe best way to observe (or set limits) on LIV. Detection of a single GRB\nneutrino would open a new window on LIV and would improve current limits by\nmany orders of magnitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2006 20:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In\norder to obtain functorial properties for non-abelain groups, in particular a\ntensor product formula, we endow S_0(G) with an operator space structure. With\nthis structure S_0(G) is simultaneously an operator Segal algebra of the\nFourier algebra A(G), and of the group algebra L^1(G). We show that this\noperator space structure is consistent with the major functorial properties:\n(i) S_0(G)\\hat{\\otimes}S_0(H)=S_0(G\\times H) completely isomorphically\n(operator projective tensor product), if H is another locally compact group;\n(ii) the restriction map u\\mapsto u|_H:S_0(G)\\to S_0(H) is completely\nsurjective, if H is a closed subgroup; and (iii) T_N:S_0(G)\\to S_0(G/N) is\ncompletely surjective, where N is a normal subgroup and T_N u(sN)=\\int_N\nu(sn)dn. We also show that S_0(G) is an invariant for G when it is treated\nsimultaneously as a pointwise algebra and a convolutive algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2006 19:11:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 May 2007 19:08:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-05-23"}
