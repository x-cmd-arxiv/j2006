We find results that are qualitatively similar to those observed\npreviously. We observe that the threshold halo mass for formation of a\nPopulation III protostar does not evolve significantly with time in the\nredshift range studied (33 > z > 19) but exhibits substantial scatter due to\ndifferent halo assembly histories: Halos which assembled more slowly develop\ncooling cores at lower mass than those that assemble more rapidly, in agreement\nwith Yoshida et al. (2003). We do, however, observe significant evolution in\nthe accretion rates of Population III protostars with redshift, with objects\nthat form later having higher maximum accretion rates, with a variation of two\norders of magnitude (10^-4 - 10^-2 Msolar/year). This can be explained by\nconsidering the evolving virial properties of the halos with redshift and the\nphysics of molecular hydrogen formation at low densities. Our result implies\nthat the mass distribution of Population III stars inferred from their\naccretion rates may be broader than previously thought, and may evolve with\nredshift.

The detection of\nwaves from such \"extreme mass ratio inspiral\" systems (EMRIs) and extraction of\ninformation from those waves require template waveforms. The systems' extreme\nmass ratio means that their waveforms can be determined accurately using black\nhole perturbation theory. Such calculations are computationally very expensive.\nThere is a pressing need for families of approximate waveforms that may be\ngenerated cheaply and quickly but which still capture the main features of true\nwaveforms. In this paper, we introduce a family of such \"kludge\" waveforms and\ndescribe ways to generate them. We assess performance of the introduced\napproximations by comparing \"kludge\" waveforms to accurate waveforms obtained\nby solving the Teukolsky equation in the adiabatic limit (neglecting GW\nbackreaction). We find that the kludge waveforms do extremely well at\napproximating the true gravitational waveform, having overlaps with the\nTeukolsky waveforms of 95% or higher over most of the parameter space for which\ncomparisons can currently be made. Indeed, we find these kludges to be of such\nhigh quality (despite their ease of calculation) that it is possible they may\nplay some role in the final search of LISA data for EMRIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2006 11:58:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jan 2008 15:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

The asymptotic null distribution of the usual Kolmogorov--Smirnov test\nbased on the residuals generally depends on the underlying model parameters and\nthe error distribution. To overcome the dependence on the underlying model\nparameters, we propose that tests be based on a vector of certain weighted\nresidual empirical processes. Under the null hypothesis and under minimal\nmoment conditions, this vector of processes is shown to converge weakly to a\nvector of independent copies of a Gaussian process whose covariance function\ndepends only on the fitted distribution and not on the model. Under certain\nlocal alternatives, the proposed test is shown to have nontrivial asymptotic\npower. The Monte Carlo critical values of this test are tabulated when fitting\nstandard normal and double exponential distributions. The results obtained are\nshown to be applicable to GARCH and ARMA--GARCH models, the often used models\nin econometrics and finance. A simulation study shows that the test has\nsatisfactory size and power for finite samples at these models.

This phase diagram enables one\nto clearly identify not only the physically allowed states, but the set of\nstates connected under an arbitrary quantum operation. We pay particular\nattention to the maximally entangled mixed states (MEMS) of each system.\nFollowing this we investigate how efficiently one may transfer entanglement\nfrom two-mode to two-qubit states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jul 2006 15:09:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2006 14:32:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Aug 2006 07:53:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
