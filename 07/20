From the correlation of a\ncandidate INTEGRAL/IBIS survey source list with a CV catalogue, 15 CV\ndetections by IBIS have been established including a new INTEGRAL source IGR\nJ06253+7334. The properties of these sources and 4 additional CV candidates are\ndiscussed in the context of their 20-100 keV emission characteristics and we\nconclude that the INTEGRAL mission is an important tool in the detection of new\nmagnetic CV systems. Furthermore, analysis of the time-averaged spectra of CVs\ndetected by INTEGRAL indicate that although there is little difference between\nthe spectral slopes of the different sub-types, intermediate polars may be\nconsiderably more luminous than polars in the soft gamma-ray regime. We also\npresent the detection of an unusual high-energy burst from V1223 Sgr discovered\nby inspection of the IBIS light-curve. Additionally, we have compared the IBIS\nand optical AAVSO light-curves of SS Cyg and extracted IBIS spectra during\nsingle periods of optical outburst and quiescence. We find that the 20-100 keV\nflux is an order of magnitude greater during optical quiescence. This is in\nagreement with previous studies which show that the hard X-ray component of SS\nCyg is suppressed during high accretion states\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2006 13:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In the present paper\nwe investigate the possibility of applying the formalism of higher gauge theory\nto gravity in (2+1) dimensions, and we show that a nontrivial model of\n(2+1)-dimensional gravity coupled to scalar and tensorial matter fields - the\n$\\Sigma\\Phi EA$ model - can be formulated both as a standard gauge theory and\nas a higher gauge theory. Since the model has a very rich structure - it admits\nas solutions black-hole BTZ-like geometries, particle-like geometries as well\nas Robertson-Friedman-Walker cosmological-like expanding geometries - this\nopens a wide perspective for higher gauge theory to be tested and understood in\na relevant gravitational context. Additionally, it offers the possibility of\nstudying gravity in (2+1) dimensions coupled to matter in an entirely new\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 20 Jul 2006 05:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2006 07:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Dynamical systems with time operators are intrinsically\nirreversible because they admit Lyapounov operators as functions of the time\noperator. For quantum systems selfadjoint time operators are defined in the\nsame way or as dilations of symmetric ones dealing with the time-energy\nuncertainty relation, times of occurrence or survival probabilities. This work\ntackles the question of the existence of selfadjoint time operators on the\nbasis of the Halmos-Helson theory of invariant subspaces, the Sz.-Nagy-Foias\ndilation theory and the Misra-Prigogine-Courbage theory of irreversibility. It\nis shown that the existence of a selfadjoint time operator for a unitary\nevolution is equivalent to the intrinsic irreversibility of the evolution plus\nthe existence of a simply invariant subspace or a rigid operator-valued\nfunction for its Sz.-Nagy-Foias functional model. An extensive set of\nequivalent conditions to the existence of selfadjoint time operators can be\nobtained from these results. Such conditions are written in terms of\nSchr\\\"odinger couples, the Weyl commutation relation, incoming and outgoing\nsubspaces, innovation processes, Lax-Phillips scattering processes, and\ntranslation and spectral representations.

The low density limit is the\nkinetic Markovian regime when only pair collisions (i.e., collisions of the\ntest particle with one particle of the gas at one time moment) contribute to\nthe dynamics. In the white noise approach one first proves that the appropriate\noperators describing the gas converge in the sense of appropriate matrix\nelements to certain operators of quantum white noise. Then these white noise\noperators are used to derive quantum white noise and quantum stochastic\nequations describing the approximate dynamics of the total system consisting of\nthe particle and the gas. The derivation is given ab initio, starting from the\nexact microscopic quantum dynamics. The limiting dynamics is described by a\nquantum stochastic equation driven by a quantum Poisson process. This equation\nthen applied to the derivation of quantum Langevin equation and linear\nBoltzmann equation for the reduced density matrix of the test particle. The\nfirst part of the paper describes the approach which was developed by L.\nAccardi, I.V. Volovich and the author and uses the Fock-antiFock (or GNS)\nrepresentation for the CCR algebra of the gas. The second part presents the\napproach to the derivation of the limiting equations directly in terms of the\ncorrelation functions, without use of the Fock-antiFock representation. This\napproach simplifies the derivation and allows to express the strength of the\nquantum number process directly in terms of the one-particle $S$-matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jul 2006 20:07:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This method directly accounts for each two-body\ninteraction, rather than an average interaction so that even lowest-order\nresults include beyond-mean-field effects. It is thus appropriate for the study\nof both weakly and strongly interacting systems and the transition between\nthem.
