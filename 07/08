In addition, although BCGs are hardly\noffset from the Fundamental Plane defined by the bulk of the early-type\npopulation, they show considerably smaller scatter. The larger than expected\nsizes of BCGs, and the increased homogeneity, are qualitatively consistent with\nmodels which seek to explain the colors of the most massive galaxies by\ninvoking dry dissipationless mergers, since dissipation tends to reduce the\nsizes of galaxies, and wet mergers which result in star formation would tend to\nincrease the scatter in luminosity at fixed size and velocity dispersion.\nFurthermore, BCGs define the same g-r color-magnitude relation as the bulk of\nthe early-type population. If BCGs formed from dry mergers, then BCG\nprogenitors must have been red for their magnitudes, suggesting that they\nhosted older stellar populations than typical for their luminosities. Our\nfindings have two other consequences. First, the R_e-L relation of the\nearly-type galaxy population as a whole (i.e., normal plus BCG) exhibits some\ncurvature. Some of this curvature must be a consequence of the fact that an\nincreasing fraction of the most luminous galaxies are BCGs. The second\nconsequence is suggested by the fact that, despite following a steeper\nsize-luminosity relation, BCGs tend to define a tight relation between\ndynamical mass R_e sigma^2/G and luminosity. As consequence, we find that BCGs\ndefine a shallower sigma-L relation than the bulk of the early-type galaxy\npopulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2006 16:05:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Dec 2006 19:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Alternatively, it has been proposed that apparent\ndynamical evidence of dark matter is due to a modification of Newtons's law of\ngravitation. Here we revisit the Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) theories at\nthe scale of galaxy clusters. Using hydrodynamical simulations, we derived\nquantities such as the density and the temperature of the ICM. We compared\nthose MOND simulated predictions to high quality X-ray density and temperature\nprofiles observed down to ~0.5 the virial radius.

In order to solve this problem and to reconcile MOND\nwith clusters observations, we investigated the possibility of an added dark\nbaryonic component.

Here we present optical spectra of six\nisolated planetary mass candidates in Chamaeleon II, Lupus I and Ophiuchus\nstar-forming regions, recently identified by Allers and collaborators to harbor\nsubstantial mid-infrared excesses. Our spectra, from ESO's Very Large Telescope\nand New Technology Telescope, show that four of the targets have spectral types\nin the ~M9-L1 range, and three of those also exhibit H_alpha. Their\nluminosities are consistent with masses of ~5-15 M_{Jupiter} according to\nmodels of Chabrier, Baraffe and co-workers, thus placing these four objects\namong the lowest mass brown dwarfs known to be surrounded by circum-sub-stellar\ndisks. Our findings bolster the idea that free-floating planetary mass objects\ncould have infancies remarkably similar to those of Sun-like stars and suggest\nthe intriguing possibility of planet formation around primaries whose masses\nare comparable to those of extra-solar giant planets. Another target appears to\nbe a brown dwarf (~M8) with prominent H_alpha emission, possibly arising from\naccretion.

While these predictions can result in\nextremely short migration timescales for cores of a few Earth masses, recent\nnumerical calculations have given an unexpected outcome: the torque acting on\nplanets with masses between 5 M_Earth and 20 M_Earth is considerably smaller\nthan the analytic, linear estimate. These findings motivated the present work,\nwhich investigates existence and origin of this discrepancy or ``offset'', as\nwe shall call it, by means of two and three dimensional numerical calculations.\nWe show that the offset is indeed physical and arises from the coorbital\ncorotation torque, since (i) it scales with the disk vortensity gradient, (ii)\nits asymptotic value depends on the disk viscosity, (iii) it is associated to\nan excess of the horseshoe zone width. We show that the offset corresponds to\nthe onset of non-linearities of the flow around the planet, which alter the\nstreamline topology as the planet mass increases: at low mass the flow\nnon-linearities are confined to the planet's Bondi sphere whereas at larger\nmass the streamlines display a classical picture reminiscent of the restricted\nthree body problem, with a prograde circumplanetary disk inside a ``Roche\nlobe''.

Intense variability, with amplitude as large as 40% of the total\nflux, was observed both times. Similarities can be found between the two\nobservations in the structure of the variations.

We argue that the double cores of the CO absorption lines, that\nhave previously been attributed to separate circumstellar shells expelled\nduring its recurrent outbursts, result in fact from a superposition of a wide\nabsorption line and a narrow central emission line. The CO line doubling\nreturns over subsequent pulsation cycles, where the superposed line emission\nassumes its largest intensity near phases of maximum light. We find that the\nmorphology and behavior of the CO band closely resemble the remarkable\n\"line-splitting phenomenon\" also observed in optical low-excitation atomic\nlines. Based on radiative transport calculations we present a simplified model\nof the near-IR CO emission emerging from cooler atmospheric layers in the\nimmediate vicinity of the photosphere.

We studied radial\ndistributions of temperature and metal abundance with joint spectral fit for\nthe Chandra and XMM-Newton data, and two temperatures were required in the\ninner r< 2' (35 kpc) region.

However, similar understanding in the low-order (sub-diffusion)\nscattering regime is not complete due to difficulties in tracking photons that\nundergo very few scatterings events. Recent developments in low-coherence\nenhanced backscattering (LEBS) overcome these difficulties and enable probing\nphotons that travel very short distances and undergo only a few scattering\nevents. In LEBS, enhanced backscattering is observed under illumination with\nspatial coherence length L_sc less than the scattering mean free path l_s. In\norder to understand the mechanisms of photon propagation in LEBS in the\nsubdiffusion regime, it is imperative to develop analytical and numerical\nmodels that describe the statistical properties of photon trajectories. Here we\nderive the probability distribution of penetration depth of LEBS photons and\nreport Monte Carlo numerical simulations to support our analytical results. Our\nresults demonstrate that, surprisingly, the transport of photons that undergo\nlow-order scattering events has only weak dependence on the optical properties\nof the medium (l_s and anisotropy factor g) and strong dependence on the\nspatial coherence length of illumination, L_sc, relative to those in the\ndiffusion regime.

Since quantum tomograms are\nwell defined probability distributions, the tomographic approach is emphasized\nto be the most natural one to compare the predictions of classical and quantum\ntheory. Examples of inequalities for two qubits an two qutrits are considered\nin the tomographic probability representation of spin states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 8 Jul 2006 13:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Sep 2006 13:46:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
