We find that the fraction of galaxies on the red sequence depends\nstrongly on local environment out to z > 1, being larger in regions of greater\ngalaxy density. At all epochs probed, we also find a small population of red,\nmorphologically early-type galaxies residing in regions of low measured\noverdensity. The observed correlations between the red fraction and local\noverdensity are highly significant, with the trend at z > 1 detected at a\ngreater than 5-\\sigma level. Over the entire redshift regime studied, we find\nthat the color-density relation evolves continuously, with red galaxies more\nstrongly favoring overdense regions at low z relative to their red-sequence\ncounterparts at high redshift. At z ~ 1.3, the red fraction only weakly\ncorrelates with overdensity, implying that any color dependence to the\nclustering of ~ L* galaxies at that epoch must be small.

The standard approach is to assume that, as\ntemperatures heat up during star formation, methanol and other species\nevaporate from grain surfaces and undergo a warm gas-phase chemistry at 100 K\nor greater to produce species such as methyl formate, dimethyl ether, and\nothers. But a series of laboratory results shows that protonated ions, typical\nprecursors to final products in ion-molecule schemes, tend to fragment upon\ndissociative recombination with electrons rather than just ejecting a hydrogen\natom. Moreover, the specific proposed reaction to produce protonated methyl\nformate is now known not to occur at all. Methods: We utilize a gas-grain\nchemical network to probe the chemistry of the relatively ignored stage of hot\ncore evolution during which the protostar switches on and the temperature of\nthe surrounding gas and dust rises from 10 K to over 100 K. During this stage,\nsurface chemistry involving heavy radicals becomes more important as surface\nhydrogen atoms tend to evaporate rather than react. Results: Our results show\nthat complex species such as methyl formate, formic acid, and dimethyl ether\ncan be produced in large abundance during the protostellar switch-on phase, but\nthat both grain-surface and gas-phase processes help to produce most species.\nThe longer the timescale for protostellar switch-on, the more important the\nsurface processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2006 13:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In contrast to mean\nfield theory, increasing $J_{pd}$ may not favor high Curie temperatures: $T_C$\nscales primarily with the bandwidth. High temperature ferromagnetism at small\ndilutions is associated with resonant structure in the p-band. Comparison to\ndiluted magnetic semiconductors indicate that Ga(Mn)As has such a resonant\nstructure and thus this material is already close to optimality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2006 14:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The CSP\nmay be viewed as the problem of deciding the truth of a logical sentence\nconsisting of a conjunction of constraints, in front of which all variables are\nexistentially quantified. The quantified constraint satisfaction problem (QCSP)\nis the generalization of the CSP where universal quantification is permitted in\naddition to existential quantification. The general intractability of these\nproblems has motivated research studying the complexity of these problems under\na restricted constraint language, which is a set of relations that can be used\nto express constraints.\n  This paper introduces collapsibility, a technique for deriving positive\ncomplexity results on the QCSP. In particular, this technique allows one to\nshow that, for a particular constraint language, the QCSP reduces to the CSP.\nWe show that collapsibility applies to three known tractable cases of the QCSP\nthat were originally studied using disparate proof techniques in different\ndecades: Quantified 2-SAT (Aspvall, Plass, and Tarjan 1979), Quantified\nHorn-SAT (Karpinski, Kleine B\\\"{u}ning, and Schmitt 1987), and Quantified\nAffine-SAT (Creignou, Khanna, and Sudan 2001).

When considering the properties of an electromagnetic medium\nunder an arbitrary coordinate transformation an alternative interpretation\npresents itself. The transformed material property tensors may be interpreted\nas a different set of material properties in a flat, Cartesian space. We\ndescribe the calculation of these material properties for coordinate\ntransformations that describe spaces with spherical or cylindrical holes in\nthem. The resulting material properties can then implement invisibility cloaks\nin flat space. We also describe a method for performing geometric ray tracing\nin these materials which are both inhomogeneous and anisotropic in their\nelectric permittivity and magnetic permeability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2006 16:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

In the experimental data there are\nvisible non-negligible deviations of probabilities $P_{++}^{\\rm{exp}}(\\alpha,\n\\beta), P_{+-}^{\\rm{exp}}(\\alpha, \\beta), P_{-+}^{\\rm{exp}}(\\alpha, \\beta),\nP_{--}^{\\rm{exp}}(\\alpha, \\beta) $ from the predictions of quantum mechanics,\nnamely, $P_{++}(\\alpha, \\beta)=P_{--}(\\alpha, \\beta)=\n{1/2}\\cos^2(\\alpha-\\beta)$ and $P_{+-}=P_{-+}(\\alpha,\n\\beta)={1/2}\\sin^2(\\alpha-\\beta).$ However, in some mysterious way those\ndeviations compensate each other and finally the correlation\n$E^{\\rm{exp}}(\\alpha, \\beta)= P_{++}^{\\rm{exp}}(\\alpha, \\beta)-\nP_{+-}^{\\rm{exp}}(\\alpha, \\beta)- P_{-+}^{\\rm{exp}}(\\alpha, \\beta)+\nP_{--}^{\\rm{exp}}(\\alpha, \\beta)$ is in the complete agreement with the\nQM-prediction, namely, $E(\\alpha, \\beta)= P_{++}(\\alpha, \\beta)- P_{+-}(\\alpha,\n\\beta)- P_{-+}(\\alpha, \\beta)+ P_{--}(\\alpha, \\beta)= \\cos 2(\\alpha-\\beta).$\nTherefore such anomalies play no role in the Bell's inequality framework.\nNevertheless, other linear combinations of experimental probabilities do not\nhave such a compensation property. There can be found non-negligible deviations\nfrom predictions of quantum mechanics. Thus neither classical nor quantum model\ncan pass the whole family of statistical tests given by all possible linear\ncombinations of the EPR-Bohm probabilities. Does it mean that both models are\nwrong?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jul 2006 10:02:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
