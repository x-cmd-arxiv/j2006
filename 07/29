To address this\nquestion, I first put forward three general criteria for selecting the relevant\nastrophysical environments. Namely, reconnection should be: fast; energetically\nimportant; and observable. From this, I deduce that the gas density should be\nlow, so that the plasma is: collisionless; force-free; and optically thin.\nThus, for example, the requirement that reconnection is fast implies that\nPetschek's reconnection mechanism must be operating, which is possible,\napparently, only in the collisionless regime. Next, I argue that the force-free\ncondition implies that the magnetic field be produced in, and anchored by, a\nnearby dense massive object, e.g., a star or a disk, strongly stratified by\ngravity. I then stress the importance of field-line opening (e.g., by\ndifferential rotation) as a means to form a reconnecting current sheet.\nCorrespondingly, I suggest the Y-point helmet streamer as a generic\nprototypical magnetic configuration relevant to large-scale reconnection in\nastrophysics. Finally, I discuss several specific astrophysical systems where\nthe above criteria are met: stellar coronae, magnetically-interacting\nstar--disk systems, and magnetized coronae above turbulent accretion disks. In\nthe Appendix, I apply the ideas put forward in this talk to the solar coronal\nheating problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jul 2006 19:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Continuous time random walks (CTRWs) are general models capable to\ncapture the small-scale properties that high frequency data series show. The\nuse of CTRW models in the analysis of financial problems is quite recent and\ntheir potentials have not been fully developed. Here we present two (closely\nrelated) applications of great interest in risk control. In the first place, we\nwill review the problem of modelling the behaviour of the mean exit time (MET)\nof a process out of a given region of fixed size. The surveyed stochastic\nprocesses are the cumulative returns of asset prices. The link between the\nvalue of the MET and the timescale of the market fluctuations of a certain\ndegree is crystal clear. In this sense, MET value may help, for instance, in\ndeciding the optimal time horizon for the investment. The MET is, however, one\namong the statistics of a distribution of bigger interest: the survival\nprobability (SP), the likelihood that after some lapse of time a process\nremains inside the given region without having crossed its boundaries. The\nfinal part of the article is devoted to the study of this quantity. Note that\nthe use of SPs may outperform the standard \"Value at Risk\" (VaR) method for two\nreasons: we can consider other market dynamics than the limited Wiener process\nand, even in this case, a risk level derived from the SP will ensure (within\nthe desired quintile) that the quoted value of the portfolio will not leave the\nsafety zone.

These variances can be weighted at various spatial\nscales, leading to a family of multi-scale mixing measures and efficiencies. We\nderive a priori estimates on these efficiencies from the advection--diffusion\npartial differential equation, focusing on a broad class of statistically\nhomogeneous and isotropic incompressible flows. The analysis produces bounds on\nthe mixing efficiencies in terms of the Peclet number, a measure the strength\nof the stirring relative to molecular diffusion. We show by example that the\nestimates are sharp for particular source, sink and flow combinations. In\ngeneral the high-Peclet number behavior of the bounds (scaling exponents as\nwell as prefactors) depends on the structure and smoothness properties of, and\nlength scales in, the scalar source and sink distribution. The fundamental\nmodel of the stirring of a monochromatic source/sink combination by the random\nsine flow is investigated in detail via direct numerical simulation and\nanalysis. The large-scale mixing efficiency follows the upper bound scaling\n(within a logarithm) at high Peclet number but the intermediate and small-scale\nefficiencies are qualitatively less than optimal. The Peclet number scaling\nexponents of the efficiencies observed in the simulations are deduced\ntheoretically from the asymptotic solution of an internal layer problem arising\nin a quasi-static model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jul 2006 01:54:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2011 12:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-03"}
