The photometric evolution is characterised by a comparatively slow\npost-maximum decline of the light curves. The peaks in redder bands are\nsignificantly delayed relative to the bluer bands, the I-band maximum occurring\n8.4 days later than that in B. With an absolute peak magnitude of -18.02 in the\nV band the SN can be considered fairly bright, but not exceptional. This also\nholds for the U through I bolometric light curve, where SN 2004aw has a\nposition intermediate between SNe 2002ap and 1998bw. Spectroscopically SN\n2004aw provides a link between a normal Type Ic supernova like SN 1994I and the\ngroup of broad-lined SNe Ic. The spectral evolution is rather slow, with a\nspectrum at day +64 being still predominantly photospheric. The shape of the\nnebular [O I] 6300,6364 line indicates a highly aspherical explosion. Helium\ncannot be unambiguously identified in the spectra, even in the near-infrared.\nUsing an analytical description of the light curve peak we find that the total\nmass of the ejecta in SN 2004aw is 3.5-8.0 M_Sun, significantly larger than in\nSN 1994I, although not as large as in SN 1998bw.

Taking the IRAS/DIRBE extinction\nvalues (Schlegel et al. 1998) at face value, the absorption in the optical\n(A_B) ranges from ~2m to over 100m across the Galactic Plane. Comparing the\ndetections with other systematic surveys, we conclude that this search is\nhighly complete up to the detection limits of the DENIS survey and certainly\nsurpasses any automatic galaxy finding algorithm applied to crowded areas. The\nNIR galaxy colours from the 7\" aperture were used as a probe to measure total\nGalactic extinction. A comparison with the IRAS/DIRBE Galactic reddening maps\nsuggests that the IRAS/DIRBE values result in a slight overestimate of the true\nextinction at such low Galactic latitudes; the inferred extinction from the\ngalaxy colours corresponds to about 87% of the IRAS/DIRBE extinctions. Although\nthis determination still shows some scatter, it proves the usefulness of NIR\nsurveys for calibrating the IRAS/DIRBE maps in the extinction range of 2m < A_B\n< 12m.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2006 15:04:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In the present work we tackle this issue, extending our theoretical\nanalysis of Au conductance histograms [Dreher et al., PRB 72, 075435 (2005)] to\ndifferent types of metals, namely, Ag, Pt and ferromagnetic Ni.

We shall also briefly discuss investigations of Al atomic-sized\ncontacts. From our analysis we conclude that the differences in the histograms\nof these metals are due to (i) the very different electronic structures, which\nmeans different atomic orbitals contributing to the transport, and (ii) the\ndifferent mechanical properties, which in a case like Pt lead to the formation\nof special structures, namely monoatomic chains.

Indeed, a sharp magnetic\nexcitation termed \"resonance\" has been observed by neutron scattering in a\nnumber of hole-doped materials.

In the case of nearly disjoint\nblocks, perturbation theory shows that if the perturbations are small the zeros\nin the leading vectors are replaced by small numbers (pseudo-zeros). Since the\nsingular values of each block might be very different in magnitude, their order\ndoes not mirror the order of blocks.

Finally, the near-horizon structure\nof a black hole is found to be very restricted, adding credence to the ideas\nput forward by Carlip and Solodukhin that the black hole entropy is related to\nan inherited symmetry from the classical theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jul 2006 03:54:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By\ncarrying out the analog of Witten's analysis for the new orientifold large\n$N_c$ limit, we show that baryons and solitons can also be identified in the\norientifold large $N_c$ limit. However, in the orientifold large $N_c$ limit,\nthe interaction amplitudes and matrix elements scale with $N_c^{-1}$ in the\nsame way as soliton models scale with the generic meson coupling constant $g$\nrather than as $N_c^{-1/2}$ as in the traditional large $N_c$ limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2006 17:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-03"}

In particular, we\nanalyze the stability of a well-known delayed nonlinear implementation of a\ncertain Internet congestion control protocol. We also describe a generalized\nmethodology for proving stability of time-delay systems through the use of\nsemidefinite programming. In Chapters 4 and 5, we consider an Internet\ncongestion control protocol based on the decentralized gradient projection\nalgorithm. For a certain class of utility function, this algorithm was shown to\nbe globally convergent for some sufficiently small value of a gain parameter.\nLater work gave an explicit bound on this gain for a linearized version of the\nsystem. This thesis proves that this bound also implies stability of the\noriginal system. In Chapter 7, we describe a general methodology for proving\nstability of linear time-delay systems by computing solutions to an\noperator-theoretic version of the Lyapunov inequality via semidefinite\nprogramming. The result is stated in terms of a nested sequence of sufficient\nconditions which are of increasing accuracy. This approach is generalized to\nthe case of parametric uncertainty by considering parameter-dependent Lyapunov\nfunctionals. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate convergence of the\nalgorithm.

For this we will use a slope h\ndecomposition of compact supported cohomology with values in overconvergent\ndistribution, which can be interpreted as a cohomological description of\nColeman p-adic family, and define the p-adic Hecke algebra for the slope h part\nof this cohomology.

As is\nknown, intially smooth density (or temperature) profiles develop into fronts in\nthe very early stages of evolution. This results in a frontally dominated\n$k^{-1}$ potential energy spectrum. The fronts, initially characterized by a\nrelatively simple geometry, spontaneously develop into severely distorted\nsheets that possess structure at very fine scales, and thus there is a transfer\nof energy from large to small scales. It is shown here that this process\nculminates in the establishment of a $k^{-5/3}$ kinetic energy spectrum,\nalthough its scaling extends over a shorter range as compared to the $k^{-1}$\nscaling of the potential energy spectrum. The establishment of the kinetic\nenergy scaling signals the onset of enstrophy decay which proceeds in a mildly\nmodulated exponential manner and possesses a novel self-similarity.\nSpecifically, the self-similarity is seen in the time invariant nature of the\nprobability density function (\\pdf{}) associated with the normalized vorticity\nfield.

We also briefly indicate an analogous\nnotion for distilling entanglement using the same class of (one-way) channels,\nyielding one of the few entanglement measures that is monotonic under local\noperations with one-way classical communication (1-LOCC), but not under the\nmore general class of local operations with classical communication (LOCC).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 5 Jul 2006 21:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jul 2006 00:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Aug 2008 15:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-28"}
