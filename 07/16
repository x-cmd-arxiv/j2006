Recent\nobservations by the HESS instrument reveal that supernova remnants also emit\nTeV gamma-rays; long awaited experimental evidence that supernova remnants can\naccelerate cosmic rays up to the ``knee'' energies. Still, uncertainty exists\nwhether these gamma-rays are produced by electrons via inverse Compton\nscattering or by protons via neutral pion decay. The multi-wavelength spectra\nof supernova remnants can be fitted with both mechanisms, although a preference\nis often given to neutral pion decay due to the spectral shape at very high\nenergies. A recent study of the interstellar radiation field indicates that its\nenergy density, especially in the inner Galaxy, is higher than previously\nthought. In this paper we evaluate the effect of the interstellar radiation\nfield on the inverse Compton emission of electrons accelerated in a supernova\nremnant located at different distances from the Galactic Centre. We show that\ncontribution of optical and infra-red photons to the inverse Compton emission\nmay exceed the contribution of cosmic microwave background and in some cases\nbroaden the resulted gamma-ray spectrum. Additionally, we show that if a\nsupernova remnant is located close to the Galactic Centre its gamma-ray\nspectrum will exhibit a ``universal'' cutoff at very high energies due to the\nKlein-Nishina effect and not due to the cut-off of the electron spectrum. As an\nexample, we apply our calculations to the supernova remnants RX J1713.7-3946\nand G0.9+0.1 recently observed by HESS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jul 2006 22:36:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A theory of collisionless shocks\nbased on first principles does not, however, exist. Observations of gamma-ray\nburst (GRB) \"afterglows\" provide a unique opportunity for diagnosing the\nphysics of relativistic collisionless shocks. Most GRBs are believed to be\nassociated with explosions of massive stars. Their \"afterglows,\" delayed low\nenergy emission following the prompt burst of gamma-rays, are well accounted\nfor by a model in which afterglow radiation is due to synchrotron emission of\nelectrons accelerated in relativistic collisionless shock waves driven by the\nexplosion into the surrounding plasma. Within the framework of this model, some\nstriking characteristics of collisionless relativistic shocks are implied.\nThese include the generation of downstream magnetic fields with energy density\nexceeding that of the upstream field by ~8 orders of magnitude, the survival of\nthis strong field at distances ~10^{10} skin-depths downstream of the shock,\nand the acceleration of particles to a power-law energy spectrum, d\\log n/d\\log\nE ~ -2, possibly extending to 10^{20}eV.
