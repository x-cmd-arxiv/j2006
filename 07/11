Upon gravitationally scattering\nplanetesimal debris, planets migrate. Orbital migration can lead to resonance\ncapture, as evidenced here in the Kuiper and asteroid belts, and abroad in\nextra-solar systems. Finite sizes of planetesimals render migration stochastic\n(\"noisy\"). At fixed disk mass, larger (fewer) planetesimals generate more\nnoise. Extreme noise defeats resonance capture. We employ order-of-magnitude\nphysics to construct an analytic theory for how a planet's orbital semi-major\naxis fluctuates in response to random planetesimal scatterings. To retain a\nbody in resonance, the planet's semi-major axis must not random walk a distance\ngreater than the resonant libration width. We translate this criterion into an\nanalytic formula for the retention efficiency of the resonance as a function of\nsystem parameters, including planetesimal size. We verify our results with\ntailored numerical simulations. Application of our theory reveals that capture\nof Resonant Kuiper belt objects by a migrating Neptune remains effective if the\nbulk of the primordial disk was locked in bodies having sizes < O(100) km and\nif the fraction of disk mass in objects with sizes > 1000 km was less than a\nfew percent.

Recently, an explicit mean-field description in\nthe form of a Fokker-Planck equation was derived for frequency-dependent\nselection with two strategies in finite populations based on microscopic\nprocesses [A.Traulsen, J.C. Claussen, and C.Hauert, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 238701\n(2005)]. Here we generalize this approach in a twofold way: First, we extend\nthe framework to an arbitrary number of strategies and second, we allow for\nmutations in the evolutionary process. The deterministic limit of infinite\npopulation size of the frequency dependent Moran process yields the adjusted\nreplicator-mutator equation, which describes the combined effect of selection\nand mutation. For finite populations, we provide an extension taking random\ndrift into account. In the limit of neutral selection, i.e. whenever the\nprocess is determined by random drift and mutations, the stationary strategy\ndistribution is derived. This distribution forms the background for the\ncoevolutionary process. In particular, a critical mutation rate $u_c$ is\nobtained separating two scenarios: above $u_c$ the population predominantly\nconsists of a mixture of strategies whereas below $u_c$ the population tends to\nbe in homogenous states. For one of the fundamental problems in evolutionary\nbiology, the evolution of cooperation under Darwinian selection, we demonstrate\nthat the analytical framework provides excellent approximations to individual\nbased simulations even for rather small population sizes. This approach\ncomplements simulation results and provides a deeper, systematic understanding\nof coevolutionary dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2006 13:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this\npaper, we point out that a natural ``minimal'' framework that accomplishes this\ncan be constructed by combining the bulk-neutrino hypothesis for right-handed\nneutrinos with the split-fermion scenario for left-handed neutrinos. This\ncombination leads to a unique flavor signature for neutrino phenomenology which\neasily incorporates large flavor mixing angles. This hybrid scenario also has a\nnumber of additional important features. For example, one previous difficulty\nof the split-fermion scenario applied to neutrinos has been that the mass\nmatrix is exponentially sensitive to neutrino displacements within the brane.\nHowever, in our hybrid scenario, the interactions between the brane and bulk\nnaturally convert this dependence from exponential to linear. Another important\nfeature is that our hybrid scenario provides its own natural regulator for\nKaluza-Klein sums. Thus, in our scenario, all Kaluza-Klein summations are\nmanifestly finite, even in cases with multiple extra dimensions. But most\nimportantly, our mechanism completely decouples the effective neutrino flavor\nmixing angles from the sizes of the overlaps between the neutrino wavefunctions\nwithin the brane. Thus, we are able to obtain large neutrino mixing angles even\nwhen these neutrinos have significant spatial separations and their overlaps\nvanish.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2006 03:40:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

If\nrepresentations are considered, twists also serve as starproducts that\naccordingly quantize representation spaces. In physics, requirements turn out\nto be the other way around. Physics comes up with noncommutative spaces in\nterms of starproducts that miss a suiting quantum symmetry. In general the\nclassical limit is known, i.e. there exists a representation of the Lie-algebra\non a corresponding finitely generated commutative space. In this setup\nquantization can be considered independently from any representation theoretic\nissue. We construct an algebra of vector fields from a left cross-product\nalgebra of the representation space and its Hopf-algebra of momenta. The latter\ncan always be defined. The suitingly devided cross-product algebra is then\nlifted to a Hopf-algebra that carries the required genuine structure to\naccomodate a matrix representation of the universal enveloping algebra as a\nsubalgebra. We twist the Hopf-algebra of vector fields and thereby obtain the\ndesired twisting of the Lie-algebra. Since we twist with vector fields and not\nwith generators of the Lie-algebra, this is the most general twisting that can\npossibly be obtained. In other words, we push starproducts to twists of the\ndesired symmetry algebra and to this purpose solve the problem of turning\nvector fields into a Hopf-algebra.

In the latter situation, the middle\nelement displays a triple scroll attractor that is not possible to obtain when\nthe chaotic oscillator is isolated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2006 15:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The second expression for\ninelastic scattering is found using exactly solvable nonstationary 1D\nSchroedinger equation (etalon equation method), which is introduced for\ndescribing the localization properties of the full wavefunction along the curve\nof coordinate reaction. In this case we avoid a large amount of computation\ninvolved in solving the 1D Schroedinger problem along the reaction coordinate\nby using a slightly difficult initial conditions for the inelastic scattering\nequations. In both cases by solving the system of coupled first order ordinary\ndifferential equations, the full wavefunction and all S-matrix elements are\nobtained simultaneously without further calculations. Our analysis shows that\nthe methods we have developed constitute the simplest algorithms for computing\nthe reactive scattering S-matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2006 08:13:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 09:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the present work it is\nargued on the basis of the quantum mechanical relations p = k and E = h omega\nthat the energy of photons satisfies the equation E = pc/n. It is possible to\nobtain an exact prediction of the observed speed of the photons in a given\nmedium by application of Hamilton's equations of motion to the above formula,\nbut at the same time to conclude, in agreement with the arguments of Newton and\nother classical physicists, that the photon momentum increases in direct\nproportion to n, thereby producing the well-known bending of light rays toward\nthe normal when entering water from air. The corresponding relativistic\nparticle theory of light indicates that the potential V encountered by the\nphotons in a given medium is attractive for n > 1 and is momentum-dependent,\nwhich suggests the microscopic interactions responsible for the refraction of\nlight are non-Coulombic in nature and are instead akin to the spin-orbit and\norbit-orbit terms in the Breit-Pauli Hamiltonian for electrons moving in an\nexternal field. The present theory concludes that the reason photons are slowed\ndown upon entering water from air is that their relativistic mass p/v increases\nfaster with n than does their momentum, which in turn requires that Einstein's\nfamous E = mc^2 formula does not hold for light dispersion because the energy\nof the photons is expected to be the same in both media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 11 Jul 2006 08:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

There is no unifying theoretical framework in\nmathematical modeling of carcinogenesis that would account for parametric\nheterogeneity. Here we formulate a modeling approach that naturally takes stock\nof inherent cancer cell heterogeneity and illustrate it with a model of\ninteraction between a tumor and an oncolytic virus.
