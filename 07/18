The nucleus of comet 2P/Encke was observed at two vastly different\nphase angles (20 degrees and 63 degrees). Model fits to the spectral energy\ndistributions of the nucleus suggest comet Encke's infrared beaming parameter\nderived from the near-Earth asteroid thermal model may have a phase angle\ndependence. The observed emission from comet Encke's dust coma is best-modeled\nusing predominately amorphous carbon grains with a grain size distribution that\npeaks near 0.4 microns, and the silicate contribution by mass to the sub-micron\ndust coma is constrained to 31%. Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko was observed\nwith distinct coma emission in excess of a model nucleus at a heliocentric\ndistance of 5.0 AU. The coma detection suggests that sublimation processes are\nstill active or grains from recent activity remain near the nucleus. Comet\nC/2001 HT50 (LINEAR-NEAT) showed evidence for crystalline silicates in the\nspectrum obtained at 3.2 AU and we derive a silicate-to-carbon dust ratio of\n0.6. The ratio is an order of magnitude lower than that derived for comets\n9P/Tempel 1 during the Deep Impact encounter and C/1995 O1 (Hale-Bopp).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2006 14:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In\nparticular it is possible to associate $\\Psi_4$ with the outgoing gravitational\nradiation degrees of freedom, thus making it a promising tool for numerical\nwave--extraction. The right choice of the tetrad is, however, the problem to be\naddressed. We have made progress towards identifying a general procedure for\nchoosing this tetrad, by looking at transverse tetrads where $\\Psi_1=\\Psi_3=0$.\n  As a direct application of these concepts, we present a numerical study of\nthe evolution of a non-linearly disturbed black hole described by the\nBondi--Sachs metric. This particular scenario allows us to compare the results\ncoming from Weyl scalars with the results coming from the news function which,\nin this particular case, is directly associated with the radiative degrees of\nfreedom.

It describes field evolution on arbitrary\nfoliations of the flat spacetime instead of only the usual flat ones, by\ntreating the `embedding variables' which describe the foliation as dynamical\nvariables to be varied in the action in addition to the scalar field. A formal\nDirac quantization turns the constraints of PFT into functional Schrodinger\nequations which describe evolution of quantum states from an arbitrary Cauchy\nslice to an infinitesimally nearby one.This formal Schrodinger picture- based\nquantization is unitarily equivalent to the standard Heisenberg picture based\nFock quantization of the free scalar field if scalar field evolution along\narbitrary foliations is unitarily implemented on the Fock space. Torre and\nVaradarajan (TV) showed that for generic foliations emanating from a flat\ninitial slice in spacetimes of dimension greater than 2, evolution is not\nunitarily implemented, thus implying an obstruction to Dirac quantization.\n  We construct a Dirac quantization of PFT,unitarily equivalent to the standard\nFock quantization, using techniques from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) which are\npowerful enough to super-cede the no- go implications of the TV results. The\nkey features of our quantization include an LQG type representation for the\nembedding variables, embedding dependent Fock spaces for the scalar field, an\nanomaly free representation of (a generalization of) the finite transformations\ngenerated by the constraints and group averaging techniques. The difference\nbetween 2 and higher dimensions is that in the latter, only finite gauge\ntransformations are defined in the quantum theory, not the infinitesimal ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2006 08:45:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-01-30"}

This approach involves\nstudying of a new embedding invariant, of almost-embeddings and of smoothing,\nas well as explicit constructions of embeddings. Using this approach we obtain\ncomplete concrete classification results below the metastable dimension range,\ni.e. where the configuration spaces invariant of Haefliger-Wu is incomplete.\nNote that all known complete concrete classification results, except for the\nHaefliger classification of links and smooth knots, can be obtained using the\nHaefliger-Wu invariant.\n  More precisely, we classify embeddings S^p x S^{2l-1} -> R^{3l+p} for p<l in\nterms of homotopy groups of Stiefel manifolds (up to minor indeterminancies for\np>1 and for the smooth category). A particular case states that the set of\npiecewise-linear isotopy classes of piecewise-linear embeddings (or,\nequivalently, the set of almost smooth isotopy classes of smooth embeddings)\nS^1 x S^3 -> R^7 has a geometrically defined group structure, and with this\ngroup structure is isomorphic to Z + Z + Z_2.\n  We exhibit an example disproving the conjecture proposed by Viro and others\non the completeness of the multiple Haefliger-Wu invariant for classification\nof PL embeddings of connected manifolds in codimension at least 3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2006 15:02:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Aug 2007 07:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-07"}

This was followed by a sequence of two\nsupercritical Hopf-type bifurcations, first to an amplitude vacillation, then\nto a three-frequency quasi-periodic modulated amplitude vacillation (MAV), and\nfinally to a chaotic MAV\\@. In the context of the baroclinic annulus this\nsequence is unusual as the vacillation is usually found on decrease of the\nrotation rate from the steady wave flow. Further transitions of a steady wave\nwith a higher wave number pointed to the possibility that a barotropic\ninstability of the side wall boundary layers and the subsequent breakdown of\nthese barotropic vortices may play a role in the transition to structural\nvacillation and, ultimately, geostrophic turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2006 05:04:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, actual implementation\nof a quantum gate is always imperfect and takes a finite time. Therefore,\nseeking for a short sequence of gates - efficient quantum circuit for a given\noperation, is an important task. We contribute to this issue by proposing\noptimization of the well-known universal procedure proposed by Barenco et.al\n[1]. We also created a computer program which realizes both Barenco's\ndecomposition and the proposed optimization. Furthermore, our optimization can\nbe applied to any quantum circuit containing generalized Toffoli gates,\nincluding basic quantum gate circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2006 13:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Nov 2006 15:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
