Although the 3.4 micron feature has been observed to be devoid of\npolarization for one line of sight toward the Galactic center, a corresponding\nsilicate polarization measurement for the same line of sight was not available.\nHere, we present spectropolarimetric observations toward GCS 3-II and GCS 3-IV\ntoward the Galactic center, where the 9.7 micron silicate polarization has been\npreviously observed. We show that polarization is not detected across the 3.4\nmicron feature to a limit of 0.06 +/- 0.13% (GCS 3-II) and 0.15 +/- 0.31% (GCS\n3-IV), well below the lowest available prediction of polarization on the basis\nof the core-mantle model. We conclude that the hydrocarbons in the diffuse ISM\ndo not reside on the same grains as the silicates and likely form a separate\npopulation of small grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jul 2006 01:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

An innovative health strategy is being developed through the use of\ncomputer and sensory substitution via the tongue in order to compensate for the\nsensory loss in the buttock area for individuals with paraplegia. This sensory\ncompensation will enable individuals with spinal cord injuries to be aware of a\nlocalized excess of pressure at the skin/seat interface and, consequently, will\nenable them to prevent the formation of pressure ulcers by relieving the\ncutaneous area of suffering. This work reports an initial evaluation of this\napproach and the feasibility of creating an adapted behavior, with a change in\npressure as a response to electro-stimulated information on the tongue.\nObtained during a clinical study in 10 healthy seated subjects, the first\nresults are encouraging, with 92% success in 100 performed tests. These\nresults, which have to be completed and validated in the paraplegic population,\nmay lead to a new approach to education in health to prevent the formation of\npressure ulcers within this population.

If a macroscopic ensemble of resonant\ntwo-level absorbers is placed in the path of the second photon between the\nradiation source and the detector, the photon absorption does not follow Beer's\nlaw due to the time-asymmetric shape of the photon.
