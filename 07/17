Our analysis separates the Internet into three\nsub-components: (a) a nucleus which is a small (~100 nodes) very well connected\nglobally distributed subgraph; (b) a fractal sub-component that is able to\nconnect the bulk of the Internet without congesting the nucleus, with self\nsimilar properties and critical exponents; and (c) dendrite-like structures,\nusually isolated nodes that are connected to the rest of the network through\nthe nucleus only. This unique decomposition is robust, and provides insight\ninto the underlying structure of the Internet and its functional consequences.\nOur approach is general and useful also when studying other complex networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2006 15:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-23"}

The Skyrme model is supposed to encode the large $N_c$ behavior\nof baryons, and can be formulated for both of these large $N_c$ limits. There\nis an apparent paradox associated with the large $N_c$ behavior of strange\nquark matrix elements in the Skyrme model. The model only distinguishes between\nthe two large $N_c$ limits via the $N_c$ scaling of the couplings and the\nWitten-Wess-Zumino term, so that a vanishing leading order strange matrix\nelement in the TLNC limit implies that it also vanishes at leading order in the\nOLNC limit, contrary to the expectations based on the\nsuppression/non-suppression of quark loops.

We show that the government\nregulation politics was successful and leaded (i) to a decrease of the\nnonstationarities and to increase of predictability of the piglet price; (ii)\nto a coupling of the price and production cycles; (iii) to increase of\ndeterminism of the dynamics of the fluctuations of piglet price around the year\naverage price. The investigated case is an example confirming the thesis that a\nlarge agent can change in a significant way the environment of the small agents\nin complex (economic or financial) systems which can be crucial for their\nsurvival or extinction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2006 14:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
