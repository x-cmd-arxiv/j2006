This\nSa galaxy hosts a spectacular nuclear starburst ring and nuclear regions\ncharacterized by low-ionization emission. The gas in the ring rotates in the\nopposite sense to the stars in the galaxy, suggesting a recent merging or\nacquisition event. The combination of integral-field measurements for the\nH-alpha + [NII] emission lines from DensePak and the H-beta and [OIII] emission\nfrom Sauron allow the construction of diagnostic diagrams that highlight the\ntransition from star formation in the nuclear ring to excitation by\nhigh-velocity shocks or by a central AGN towards the center. DensePak\nmeasurements for the [SII] line ratio reveal very low gas densities in the\nnuclear ring, Ne < 100 per cm^3, characteristic of massive HII regions.\nComparison with MAPPINGS III models for starbursts with low gas densities show\nthat the ring is of roughly solar metallicity. This suggests that the gas in\nthe nuclear ring originated in a stellar system capable of substantially\nenriching the gas metallicity through sustained star formation. We suggest that\nNGC 7742 cannibalised a smaller galaxy rich in metal-poor gas, and that star\nformation episodes in the ring have since increased the metallicity to its\npresent value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2006 15:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

By this reason, (ii) the quasiparticle\nlifetime as well as the local density of states (DOS) are strongly suppressed\nin a wide area around the impurity (like a Swiss cheese hole), which causes the\n``huge residual resistivity'' beyond the s-wave unitary scattering limit.

In particular we define integral invariants which obstruct the\nexistence of transverse K\\\"ahler metric with harmonic Chern forms. The integral\ninvariant $f_1$ for the first Chern class case becomes an obstruction to the\nexistence of transverse K\\\"ahler metric of constant scalar curvature. We prove\nthe existence of transverse K\\\"ahler-Ricci solitons (or {\\it Sasaki-Ricci\nsoliton}) on compact toric Sasaki manifolds whose basic first Chern form of the\nnormal bundle of the Reeb foliation is positive and the first Chern class of\nthe contact bundle is trivial. We will further show that if $S$ is a compact\ntoric Sasaki manifold with the above assumption then by deforming the Reeb\nfield we get a Sasaki-Einstein structure on $S$. As an application we obtain\nirregular toric Sasaki-Einstein metrics on the unit circle bundles of the\npowers of the canonical bundle of the two-point blow-up of the complex\nprojective plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jul 2006 07:09:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2006 05:01:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Dec 2006 02:48:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 29 Dec 2006 03:48:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 2007 14:07:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
