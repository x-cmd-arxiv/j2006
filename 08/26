The\nresults are puzzling, since if the opt-UV and the X-ray emission belong to a\nsingle backbody (BB), then its luminosity is too large, and this BB cannot be\ninterpreted as the signature of the shock breakout of the supernova. There are\nalso serious problems in associating the emission expected by the supernova\nshock breakout with either the opt-UV or the X-ray emission. In the former case\nwe derive too small ejecta velocities; in the latter case, on the contrary, the\nrequired velocity is too large, corresponding to the large radius of a BB\nrequired to peak close to the UV band. We then present what we think is the\nmost conservative alternative explanation, namely a synchrotron spectrum,\nself-absorbed in the opt-UV and extending up to the X-ray band, where we\nobserve the emission of the most energetic electrons, which are responsible for\nthe exponential roll-over of the spectrum. The obtained fit can explain the\nentire spectrum except the BB observed in the X-rays, which must be a separate\ncomponent. The puzzling feature of this interpretation is that the same model\nis required to explain the spectrum also at later times, up to 1e5 s, because\nthe opt-UV emission remains constant in shape and also (approximately) in\nnormalisation. In this case the observed X-ray flux is produced by self-Compton\nemission. Thus the prompt emission phase should last for ~1e5 s or more.\nFinally, we show that the BB observed in X-rays, up to 7000 seconds, can be\nphotospheric emission from the cocoon or stellar material, energized by the GRB\njet at radii comparable to the stellar radius (i.e. 1e10-1e11 cm), not very far\nfrom where this material becomes transparent (e.g. 1e12 cm).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2006 17:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Nov 2006 13:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this paper we address the question of how to extract as much\ninformation as possible from such a dataset. We have developed a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) code that is able to infer the number of oscillation\nfrequencies present in the signal and their values (with corresponding\nuncertainties), without having to fit the amplitudes and phases. Gaps in the\ndata do not have any serious consequences for this method; in cases where\nsevere aliasing exists, any ambiguity in the frequency determinations will be\nreflected in the results. It also allows us to infer parameters of the\nfrequency pattern, such as the large separation Delta nu. We have previously\napplied this method to the star nu Indi (Bedding et al 2006), and here we\ndescribe the method fully and apply it to simulated datasets, showing that the\ncode is able to give correct results even when some of the model assumptions\nare violated. In particular, the non-sinusoidal nature of the individual\noscillation modes due to stochastic excitation and damping has no major impact\non the usefulness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2006 08:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
