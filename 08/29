Next we\ndemonstrate how a Non-Commutative phase space is needed to maintain Lorentz\ninvariance for the DSR dispersion relation. Lastly we address the very\nimportant issue of velocity of this DSR particle. Exploiting the above\nNon-commutative phase space algebra in a Hamiltonian framework, we show that\nthe speed of massless particles is $c$ and for massive particles the speed\nsaturates at $c$ when the particle energy reaches the maximum value $\\kappa $,\nthe Planck mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2006 11:57:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Sep 2006 09:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Sep 2006 05:02:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 26 Sep 2006 05:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

As already reported in several articles, self-consistency\nimplies correlations between the return disturbances. As a consequence, the\nalpha's and beta's of the factor model are unobservable. Self-consistency leads\nto renormalized beta's with zero effective alpha's, which are observable with\nstandard OLS regressions. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations show\nthat, for arbitrary choices of the proxy which are different from the true\nmarket portfolio, a modified linear regression holds with a non-zero value\n$\\alpha_i$ at the origin between an asset $i$'s return and the proxy's return.\nSelf-consistency also introduces ``orthogonality'' and ``normality'' conditions\nlinking the beta's, alpha's (as well as the residuals) and the weights of the\nproxy portfolio. Two diagnostics based on these orthogonality and normality\nconditions are implemented on a basket of 323 assets which have been components\nof the S&P500 in the period from Jan. 1990 to Feb. 2005. These two diagnostics\nshow interesting departures from dynamical self-consistency starting about 2\nyears before the end of the Internet bubble. Finally, the factor decomposition\nwith the self-consistency condition derives a risk-factor decomposition in the\nmulti-factor case which is identical to the principal components analysis\n(PCA), thus providing a direct link between model-driven and data-driven\nconstructions of risk factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2006 12:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
