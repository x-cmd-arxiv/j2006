Here, we\nexamine the influence of such components on dynamical models of dwarf galaxies\nembedded in cold dark matter halos. We begin by constructing a model of\nAndromeda II, a dSph satellite of M31 which shows evidence for spatially\ndistinct stellar components. We find that the two-component model predicts an\noverall velocity dispersion profile that remains approximately constant at\n$\\sim 10 - 11$ km s$^{-1}$ out to $\\sim 1$ kpc from the center; this is despite\nwide kinematic and spatial differences between the two individual components.\nThe presence of two components may also help to explain oddities in the\nvelocity dispersion profiles of other dSphs; we show that velocity dispersion\nprofiles which appear to rise from the center outwards before leveling\noff--such as those of Leo I, Draco, and Fornax--can result from the gradual\ntransition from a dynamically cold, concentrated component to a second, hotter,\nand more spatially extended one, both in equilibrium within the same dark halo.\nDwarf galaxies with two stellar components generally have a leptokurtic\nline-of-sight velocity distribution which is well described by a double\nMaxwellian.

It is this force that is responsible for the transfer of angular\nmomentum of a neutron star to an outgoing magneto-dipole wave.

In particular, the area surveyed by 15 XMM-Newton pointings\n(of which three are archival observations), supplemented with one archival\nChandra observation, allows us to study 17 BDs with M spectral types. Half of\nthis sample (9 out of 17 BDs) is detected; 7 BDs are detected here for the\nfirst time in X-rays. We observed a flare from one BD. We confirm several\nprevious findings on BD X-ray activity: a log-log relation between X-ray and\nbolometric luminosity for stars (with L*<10 Lsun) and BDs detected in X-rays; a\nshallow log-log relation between X-ray fractional luminosity and mass; a\nlog-log relation between X-ray fractional luminosity and effective temperature;\na log-log relation between X-ray surface flux and effective temperature. We\nfind no significant log-log correlation between the X-ray fractional luminosity\nand EW(Halpha). Accreting and nonaccreting BDs have a similar X-ray fractional\nluminosity. The median X-ray fractional luminosity of nonaccreting BDs is about\n4 times lower than the mean saturation value for rapidly rotating low-mass\nfield stars. Our TMC BDs have higher X-ray fractional luminosity than BDs in\nthe Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project. The X-ray fractional luminosity declines\nfrom low-mass stars to M-type BDs, and as a sample, the BDs are less efficient\nX-ray emitters than low-mass stars. We thus conclude that while the BD\natmospheres observed here are mostly warm enough to sustain coronal activity, a\ntrend is seen that may indicate its gradual decline due to the drop in\nphotospheric ionization degree (abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2006 14:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The source of\nthe magnetic field is the azimuthal electric current associated with the\nPoynting-Robertson drag on the electrons of the accreting plasma. This current\ngenerates magnetic field loops which open up because of the differential\nrotation of the flow. We show through simple numerical simulations that what\nregulates the generation and accumulation of magnetic flux near the center is\nthe value of the plasma conductivity. Although the conductivity is usually\nconsidered to be effectively infinite for the fully ionized plasmas expected\nnear the inner edge of accretion disks, the turbulence of those plasmas may\nactually render them much less conducting due to the presence of anomalous\nresistivity. We have discovered that if the resistivity is sufficiently high\nthroughout the turbulent disk while it is suppressed interior to its inner\nedge, an interesting steady-state process is established: accretion carries and\naccumulates magnetic flux of one polarity inside the inner edge of the disk,\nwhereas magnetic diffusion releases magnetic flux of the opposite polarity to\nlarge distances. In this scenario, magnetic flux of one polarity grows and\naccumulates at a steady rate in the region inside the inner edge and up to the\npoint of equipartition when it becomes dynamically important.

However, by\ncoupling a superconducting qubit to signals on a microwave transmission line,\nit is possible to construct an integrated circuit where the presence or absence\nof even a single photon can have a dramatic effect. This system is called\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics (QED) because it is the circuit equivalent of\nthe atom-photon interaction in cavity QED. Previously, circuit QED devices were\nshown to reach the resonant strong coupling regime, where a single qubit can\nabsorb and re-emit a single photon many times. Here, we report a circuit QED\nexperiment which achieves the strong dispersive limit, a new regime of cavity\nQED in which a single photon has a large effect on the qubit or atom without\never being absorbed. The hallmark of this strong dispersive regime is that the\nqubit transition can be resolved into a separate spectral line for each photon\nnumber state of the microwave field. The strength of each line is a measure of\nthe probability to find the corresponding photon number in the cavity. This\neffect has been used to distinguish between coherent and thermal fields and\ncould be used to create a photon statistics analyzer. Since no photons are\nabsorbed by this process, one should be able to generate non-classical states\nof light by measurement and perform qubit-photon conditional logic, the basis\nof a logic bus for a quantum computer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2006 21:33:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}

We establish that\nthe relation implicitly contains the conservation of energy density at every\npoint of the system. The separate contributions to the total energy density are\ndescribed in detail, and it is shown that the key difference to standard\ndensity functional methods is the existence of a general exchange-correlation\npotential, which does not explicitly depend on electron charge. We derive\nsolutions for the hydrogen-like atoms and analyse local properties. It is found\nthat these systems are stable due to the existence of a vector potential ${\\bf\nA}$, related to electron motion, which leads to two general effects: (i) The\nroot of the charge density acquires an additional complex phase; and (ii) for\nsingle electrons, the vector potential cancels the effect of electrostatic\nrepulsions. We determine the density of states of a free electron gas based on\nthis model and find that the vectorpotential also accounts for the Pauli\nexclusion principle. Implications of these results for direct methods in\ndensity functional theory are discussed.

In the\nfirst place, we analyzed how the reduction of electron density from\nhalf-filling to quarter-filling affects the Kondo resonance in the limit of\nHubbard repulsion U=0. In general, a weak dependence with the electron density\nwas found for the local density of states (LDOS) at the impurity except when\nthe impurity, at half-filling, is close to a mixed valence regime. Next, in the\ncentral part of this paper, we studied the effects of finite Hubbard\ninteraction on the chain at quarter-filling. Our main result is that this\ninteraction drives the impurity into a more defined Kondo regime although\naccompanied in most cases by a reduction of the spectral weight of the impurity\nLDOS.

We also concluded that the conductance,\ncomputed for a small finite bias applied to the leads, follows the behavior of\nthe impurity LDOS, as in the case of non-interacting chains.

These works provide theoretical foundations for type-theoretic\nproof assistants where functions and predicates are defined by oriented\nhigher-order equations. This kind of definitions subsumes induction-based\ndefinitions, is easier to write and provides more automation. On the other\nhand, checking that user-defined rewrite rules are strongly normalizing and\nconfluent, and preserve the decidability of type-checking when combined with\nbeta-reduction, is more difficult. Most termination criteria rely on the term\nstructure.

First, we\nprove that, in the Calculus of Algebraic Constructions with size annotations,\nthe problems of type inference and type-checking are decidable, provided that\nthe sets of constraints generated by size annotations are satisfiable and admit\nmost general solutions.

The most important Lorentz-violating operators at the\nrelevant energies are parameterized by a tensor c^{nu mu) with nine independent\ncomponents. If c is nonvanishing, then there may be either a maximum electron\nvelocity less than the speed of light or a maximum energy for subluminal\nelectrons; both these quantities will generally depend on the direction of an\nelectron's motion. From synchrotron radiation, we may infer a lower bound on\nthe maximum velocity, and from inverse Compton emission, a lower bound on the\nmaximum subluminal energy.

Most naturally this is\nachieved in the framework of Everett's \"many-worlds interpretation\" of quantum\nmechanics. According to this interpretation, various classical alternatives are\nperceived by consciousness separately from each other. In the Extended Everett\nConcept (EEC) proposed by the present author, the separation of the\nalternatives is identified with the phenomenon of consciousness. This explains\nclassical character of the alternatives and unusual manifestations of\nconsciousness arising \"at the edge of consciousness\" (i.e. in sleep or trance)\nwhen its access to \"other alternative classical realities\" (other Everett's\nworlds) becomes feasible. Because of reversibility of quantum evolution in EEC,\nall time moments in the quantum world are equivalent while the impression of\nflow of time appears only in consciousness. If it is assumed that consciousness\nmay influence onto probabilities of alternatives (which is consistent in case\nof infinitely many Everett's worlds), EEC explains free will, \"probabilistic\nmiracles\" (observing low-probability events) and decreasing entropy in the\nsphere of life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2006 10:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
