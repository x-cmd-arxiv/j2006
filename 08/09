We\ndynamically treat these processes in open magnetic field regions from the\nphotospheres to 25 stellar radii. When the stars evolve to slightly blueward\npositions of the dividing line (Linsky & Haisch), the steady hot corona with\ntemperature, ~ 1MK, suddenly disappears.

We show that the strategy is optimal in a local minimax sense for the\ntrace norm distance as well as other locally quadratic figures of merit. Local\nminimax optimality means that given $n$ identical qubits, there exists no\nestimator which can perform better than the proposed estimator on a\nneighborhood of size $n^{-1/2}$ of an arbitrary state. In particular, it is\nasymptotically Bayesian optimal for a large class of prior distributions.\n  We present a physical implementation of the optimal estimation strategy based\non continuous time measurements in a field that couples with the qubits.\n  The crucial ingredient of the result is the concept of local asymptotic\nnormality (or LAN) for qubits. This means that, for large $n$, the statistical\nmodel described by $n$ identically prepared qubits is locally equivalent to a\nmodel with only a classical Gaussian distribution and a Gaussian state of a\nquantum harmonic oscillator.\n  The term `local' refers to a shrinking neighborhood around a fixed state\n$\\rho_{0}$. An essential result is that the neighborhood radius can be chosen\narbitrarily close to $n^{-1/4}$.
