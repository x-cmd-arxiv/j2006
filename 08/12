It is found that neutrino heating processes are\nnot so efficient to launch a jet in this study. It is also found that a jet is\nlaunched mainly by B_\\phi fields that are amplified by the winding-up effect.\nHowever, since the ratio of total energy relative to the rest mass energy in\nthe jet is not so high as several hundred, we conclude that the jets seen in\nthis study are not be a GRB jet. This result suggests that general relativistic\neffects, which are not included in this study, will be important to generate a\nGRB jet. Also, the accretion disk with magnetic fields may still play an\nimportant role to launch a GRB jet, although a simulation for much longer\nphysical time (\\sim 10-100 s) is required to confirm this effect. It is shown\nthat considerable amount of 56Ni is synthesized in the accretion disk. Thus\nthere will be a possibility for the accretion disk to supply sufficient amount\nof 56Ni required to explain the luminosity of a hypernova. Also, it is shown\nthat neutron-rich matter due to electron captures with high entropy per baryon\nis ejected along the polar axis. Moreover, it is found that the electron\nfraction becomes larger than 0.5 around the polar axis near the black hole by\n\\nu_e capture at the region. Thus there will be a possibility that r-process\nand r/p-process nucleosynthesis occur at these regions. Finally, much neutrons\nwill be ejected from the jet, which suggests that signals from the neutron\ndecays may be observed as the delayed bump of afterglow or gamma-rays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2006 19:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Dec 2006 21:32:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The global ratio of dust to HI gas in the ISM, while uncertain at the\nfactor of ~2 level, is ~25 times lower than the global values derived for\nspiral galaxies using similar modeling techniques; localized ratios of dust to\nHI gas are about a factor of five higher than the global value in NGC 6822.\nThere are strong variations (factors of ~10) in the relative ratios of H alpha\nand IR flux throughout the central disk; the low dust content of NGC 6822 is\nlikely responsible for the different H alpha/IR ratios compared to those found\nin more metal-rich environments.

The nonlinear structure of the 1D model has some very\ninteresting properties. On one hand, it can lead to tremendous dynamic growth\nof the solution within a short time. On the other hand, it has a surprising\ndynamic depletion mechanism that prevents the solution from blowing up in\nfinite time.

This is because a high intensity\nbeam of positively charged particles (protons, positrons, ions) creates around\nitself an electric self-field of very high intensity, $10^5 - 10^6$ V/cm.
