The decay index of early afterglow\nis very sensitive to the reference time one chooses. In order to understand the\nnature of early afterglow, it is essential to take a correct reference time.\nOur simple analytic model provides a framework to understand special\nrelativistic effects involved in early afterglow phase. We evaluate light\ncurves of reverse shock emission as well as those of forward shock emission,\nbased on full hydrodynamic calculations. We show that the reference time does\nnot shift significantly even in the thick shell case. For external shock\nemission components, measuring times from the beginning of the prompt emission\nis a good approximation and it does not cause an early steep decay. In the thin\nshell case, the energy transfer time from fireball ejecta to ambient medium\ntypically extends to thousands of seconds. This might be related to the shallow\ndecay phases observed in early X-ray afterglow at least for some bursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Aug 2006 19:36:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Oct 2006 15:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We detect for the first time a cluster of\nfour compact bipolar and monopolar outflows that show high, moderate and low\nvelocity gas and appear to be energized by millimeter and infrared sources\nassociated with this region. The SiO molecular outflows are compact ($<$ 3500\nAU), and in most of the cases, they are located very close to their exciting\nsources. We thus propose that the SiO thermal emission is tracing the youngest\nand most highly excited parts of the outflows which cannot be detected by other\nmolecules. Moreover, since the ambient cloud is weak in the SiO line emission,\nthese observations can reveal flows that in other molecular transitions will be\nconfused with the ambient velocity cloud emission. Analysis of their\npositional-velocity diagrams show that some components of these outflows may be\ndriven by wide-angle winds very close to the exciting object. Finally, we find\nthat some of these SiO outflows seem to be the base of powerful Herbig-Haro\njets and large-scale molecular flows that emanate from a few arcseconds around\nthis zone.

In\nthis work, Modified Form of Bath's Law and its application to KOERI data have\nbeen studied. Bath's law states that the differences in magnitudes between\nmainshocks and their largest detected aftershocks are approximately constant,\nindependent of the magnitudes of mainshocks and it is about 1.2. In the\nmodified form of Bath's law for a given mainshock we get the inferred largest\naftershock of this mainshock by using an extrapolation of the Gutenberg-Richter\nfrequency-magnitude statistics of the aftershock sequence. To test the\napplicability of this modified law, 6 large earthquakes that occurred in Turkey\nbetween 1950 and 2004 with magnitudes equal to or greater than 6.9 have been\nconsidered. These earthquakes take place on the North Anatolian Fault Zone.\nAdditionally, in this study the partitioning of energy during a\nmainshock-aftershock sequence was also calculated in two different ways. It is\nshown that most of the energy is released in the mainshock. The constancy of\nthe differences in magnitudes between mainshocks and their largest aftershocks\nis an indication of scale-invariant behavior of aftershock sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2006 13:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It means in the quantum transition of an atom interacting\nwith an intense laser of circular frequency $\\omega$, the energy difference\nbetween the initial and the final states of the atom is not necessarily being\nan integer multiple of the quantum energy $\\hbar\\omega$. The absorption spectra\nbecome continuous. The Bohr condition is violated. The energy of photoelectrons\nbecomes light intensity dependent in the intense laser photoelectric effect.\nThe transition probabilities and cross sections of photo-excitations and\nphoto-ionizations are laser intensity dependent, showing that these processes\ncannot be reduced to the results of interactions between the atom and separate\nindividual photons, they are rather the processes of the atom interacting with\nthe laser as a whole. The interaction of photons on atoms are not simply\nadditive. The effects are non-perturbative and non-linear. Some numerical\nresults for processes between hydrogen atom and intense circularly polarized\nlaser, illustrating the non-perturbative and non-linear character of the\natom-laser interaction, are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Aug 2006 02:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
