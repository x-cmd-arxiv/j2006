We show that nearest\nneighbor spacing distribution of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrices of\nvarious model networks, namely scale-free, small-world and random networks\nfollow universal Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics of random matrix\ntheory. Secondly we show an analogy between the onset of small-world behavior,\nquantified by the structural properties of networks, and the transition from\nPoisson to Gaussian orthogonal ensemble statistics, quantified by Brody\nparameter characterizing a spectral property. We also present our analysis for\na protein-protein interaction network in budding yeast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2006 12:19:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jul 2007 19:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

For a realistic investigation, several\nparameter sets corresponding to different values of OMSC are generated by\nadjusting the remaining parameters of the ERMF model to fit the properties of\nthe finite nuclei. Though, all these parameter sets give equally good fit to\nthe properties of the finite nuclei, only moderate values of OMSC are favored\nfrom the \"naturalness\" point of view. The equation of state for the symmetric\nnuclear and pure neutron matters resulting from the parameter sets with the\nmoderate values of OMSC are in close agreement with the ones obtained within\nthe Dirac-Brueckner-Hartree-Fock approximation. For such parameter sets the\nlimiting mass for the neutron stars composed of $\\beta$-stable matter is $\\sim\n1.9M_\\odot$. It is found that the direct Urca process can occur in the neutron\nstars with \"canonical\" mass of $1.4M_\\odot$ only for the moderate and higher\nvalues of OMSC. Some other interesting properties for the neutron stars are\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Aug 2006 07:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
