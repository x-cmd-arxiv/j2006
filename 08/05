The light charged particles\nand high-energy gamma-rays from the GDR decay have been measured in coincidence\nwith selected evaporation residues. The CACARIZO code, a Monte Carlo\nimplementation of the statistical-model code CASCADE, has been used to\ncalculate the spectral shapes of evaporated alpha-particles which are compared\nwith the experimental coincident spectra. This comparison indicates the\nsignature of large deformations (possibly superdeformed and hyperdeformed\nshapes) present in the compound nucleus decay. The occurrence of the Jacobi\nshape transition is also discussed in the framework of a newly developed\nrotating liquid drop model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2006 20:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These\neffects are of importance for Penning trap experiments which involve high\ncharge densities or require high precision in the motional frequencies. Our\nanalysis of image charges shows that only (higher order) odd powers of the\nparticle displacement lead to induced charge differences, giving rise to a\nsignal. This implies that, besides the centre-of-mass frequency of a trapped\nparticle cloud, also higher order individual particle frequencies induce a\nsignal, which can be picked up by an electronic detection circuit attached to\nthe trap electrodes.
