We have determined the distance to this\nsparse, young cluster, based on spectral classification and photometric\nmain-sequence fitting of the three B stars. The distance is found to be\n6.2+-1.2 kpc, in excellent agreement with the geometric distance to V838 Mon of\n5.9 kpc obtained from Hubble Space Telescope polarimetry of the light echoes.\nThe cluster's age is less than 25 Myr.\n  The absolute luminosity of V838 Mon during its outburst, based on our\ndistance measurement, was very similar to that of M31 RV, an object in the\nbulge of M31 that was also a cool supergiant throughout its eruption in 1988.\nHowever, there is no young population at the site of M31 RV.\n  It does not appear possible to form a nova-like cataclysmic binary system\nwithin the young age of the V838 Mon cluster, and the lack of a young\npopulation surrounding M31 RV suggests that the outburst mechanism does not\nrequire a massive progenitor. These considerations appear to leave\nstellar-collision or merger scenarios as one of the remaining viable\nexplanations for the outbursts of V838 Mon and M31 RV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2006 15:19:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nfirst study investigates the effects of different physical conditions\n(temperature, pressure, geometrical thickness) on the emergent helium\nradiation. The motion of the prominence plasma induces a Doppler dimming effect\non the resonance lines of He I and He II. The velocity effects are particularly\nimportant for the He II 304 A line as it is mostly formed by resonant diffusion\nof incident radiation under prominence conditions. The He I resonance lines at\n584 and 537 A also show some sensitivity to the motion of the plasma, all the\nmore when thermal emission is not too important in these lines. We also show\nthat it is necessary to consider partial redistribution in frequency for the\nscattering of the incident radiation.

In this\npaper we build a framework for probabilistic theories with non-fixed causal\nstructure. This combines the radical elements of general relativity and quantum\ntheory. The key idea in the construction is physical compression. A physical\ntheory relates quantities. Thus, if we specify a sufficiently large set of\nquantities (this is the compressed set), we can calculate all the others. We\napply three levels of physical compression. First, we apply it locally to\nquantities (actually probabilities) that might be measured in a particular\nregion of spacetime. Then we consider composite regions. We find that there is\na second level of physical compression for the composite region over and above\nthe first level physical compression for the component regions. Each\napplication of first and second level physical compression is quantified by a\nmatrix. We find that these matrices themselves are related by the physical\ntheory and can therefore be subject to compression. This is the third level of\nphysical compression. This third level of physical compression gives rise to a\nnew mathematical object which we call the causaloid. From the causaloid for a\nparticular physical theory we can calculate verything the physical theory can\ncalculate. This approach allows us to set up a framework for calculating\nprobabilistic correlations in data without imposing a fixed causal structure\n(such as a background time).

One or more flat directions can develop large vevs\nduring inflation, which can potentially affect reheating by slowing down\nscattering processes among inflaton decay products or by coming to dominate the\nenergy density of the Universe. Both effects occur only if flat directions are\nsufficiently long-lived. The computation of their perturbative decay rate, and\na simple estimate of their nonperturbative decay have led to the conclusion\nthat this is indeed the case. In contrast, we show that flat directions can\ndecay quickly through nonperturbative channels in realistic models. The mass\nmatrix for MSSM excitations around flat directions has nondiagonal entries,\nwhich vary with the phase of the (complex) flat directions. The quasi-periodic\nmotion of the flat directions results in a strong parametric resonance, leading\nto the rapid depletion of the flat direction within its first few rotations.\nThis may preclude any significant role for the flat directions in reheating the\nUniverse after inflation in models in which the inflaton decays perturbatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Aug 2006 18:44:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2006 20:48:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Nov 2006 16:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}

In previous work, we\nshowed that a minimal model accounting only for enzyme induction and dilution\ncaptures all the substrate consumption patterns. Here, we construct the\nbifurcation diagram of the minimal model. The bifurcation diagram explains\nseveral general properties of mixed-substrate growth. (1) In almost all cases\nof diauxic growth, the \"preferred\" substrate is the one that, by itself,\nsupports a higher specific growth rate. In the literature, this property is\noften attributed to optimality of regulatory mechanisms. Here, we show that the\nminimal model, which contains only induction, displays the property under\nfairly general conditions. This suggests that the higher growth rate of the\npreferred substrate is an intrinsic property of the induction and dilution\nkinetics.(2) The model explains the phenotypes of various mutants containing\nlesions in the regions encoding for the operator, repressor, and peripheral\nenzymes. A particularly striking phenotype is the \"reversal of the diauxie\" in\nwhich the wild-type and mutant strains consume the very same two substrates in\nopposite order. This phenotype is difficult to explain in terms of molecular\nmechanisms, but it turns out to be a natural consequence of the model. We show\nfurthermore that the model is robust. The key property of the model, namely,\nthe competitive dynamics of the enzymes, is preserved even if the model is\nmodified to account for various regulatory mechanisms. Finally, the model has\nimportant implications for size regulation in development, since it suggests\nthat protein dilution is one mechanism for coupling patterning and growth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Aug 2006 00:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
