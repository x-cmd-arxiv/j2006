Ott has introduced a more general class of candidate Transport\nProtocols called \"protocols in the TCP Paradigm\". The long run objective of\nstudying this larger class is to find protocols with promising performance\ncharacteristics. This paper studies Markov chain models derived from protocols\nin the TCP Paradigm. Protocols in the TCP Paradigm, as TCP, protect the network\nfrom congestion by reducing the \"Congestion Window\" (the amount of data allowed\nto be sent but not yet acknowledged) when there is packet loss or packet\nmarking, and increasing it when there is no loss. When loss of different\npackets are assumed to be independent events and the probability p of loss is\nassumed to be constant, the protocol gives rise to a Markov chain {W_n}, where\nW_n is the size of the congestion window after the transmission of the n-th\npacket. For a wide class of such Markov chains, we prove weak convergence\nresults, after appropriate rescaling of time and space, as p tends to 0. The\nlimiting processes are defined by stochastic differential equations. Depending\non certain parameter values, the stochastic differential equation can define an\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process or can be driven by a Poisson process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2006 19:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For decoherence induced errors such as\ndepolarization, it is presented that provided the depolarization error\nprobability is less than 1, our scheme can exponentially reduce the final\noutput error rate to zero using a number of cycles, and the output state can be\ncoherently sent to another stage of quantum computation process. Besides,\nexperimental set-ups via optical approach have been proposed using Grover's\nsearch algorithm as an example. Some further discussion on the benefits and\nlimitations of the scheme is given in the end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2006 03:28:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2006 05:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Nov 2006 02:45:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 28 Nov 2006 12:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
