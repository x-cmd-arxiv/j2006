The very\nmetal-poor, carbon-enhanced, s-process-rich stars, which are thought to be the\npolluted companions of now-extinct AGB stars, provide direct tests of the\npredictions of these models. Recent studies of the carbon and nitrogen\nabundances in metal-poor stars have focused on the most carbon-rich stars,\nleading to a potential selection bias against stars that have been polluted by\nAGB stars that produced large amounts of nitrogen, and hence have small [C/N]\nratios. We call these stars Nitrogen-Enhanced Metal-Poor (NEMP) stars, and\ndefine them as having [N/Fe] > +0.5 and [C/N] < -0.5. In this paper, we report\non the [C/N] abundances of a sample of 21 carbon-enhanced stars, all but three\nof which have [C/Fe] < +2.0. If NEMP stars were made as easily as\nCarbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, then we expected to find between two\nand seven NEMP stars. Instead, we found no NEMP stars in our sample. Therefore,\nthis observational bias is not an important contributor to the apparent dearth\nof N-rich stars. Our [C/N] values are in the same range as values reported\npreviously in the literature (-0.5 to +2.0), and all stars are in disagreement\nwith the predicted [C/N] ratios for both low-mass and high-mass AGB stars. We\nsuggest that the decrease in [C/N] from the low-mass AGB models is due to\nenhanced extra-mixing, while the lack of NEMP stars may be caused by\nunfavorable mass ratios in binaries or the difficulty of mass transfer in\nbinary systems with large mass ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2006 15:37:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

These vacuum densities correspond to a\ngravitational source of the cosmological constant type for both subspaces of\nthe branes. Using the generalized zeta function technique in combination with\ncontour integral representations, the surface energies on the branes are\npresented in the form of the sum of single brane and second brane induced\nparts. For the geometry of a single brane both regions, on the left and on the\nright of the brane, are considered. At the physical point the corresponding\nzeta functions contain pole and finite contributions. For an infinitely thin\nbrane taking these regions together, in odd spatial dimensions the pole parts\ncancel and the total zeta function is finite. The renormalization procedure for\nthe surface energies and the structure of the corresponding counterterms are\ndiscussed. The parts in the surface densities generated by the presence of the\nsecond brane are finite for all nonzero values of the interbrane separation and\nare investigated in various asymptotic regions of the parameters. In\nparticular, it is shown that for large distances between the branes the induced\nsurface densities give rise to an exponentially suppressed cosmological\nconstant on the brane. The total energy of the vacuum including the bulk and\nboundary contributions is evaluated by the zeta function technique and the\nenergy balance between separate parts is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2006 20:15:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Sep 2006 12:51:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We will discuss\nmeasurements of nuclear modification factors for light hadrons and non-photonic\nelectrons from heavy quark decays, which reflect the flavor dependence of\nenergy loss of high momentum partons traversing the dense QCD medium. The\nhadronization of bulk partonic matter exhibits collectivity in effective\npartonic degrees of freedom. Nuclear collisions at RHIC provide an intriguing\nenvironment, where many constituent quark ingredients are readily available for\npossible formation of exotic particles through quark coalescences or\nrecombinations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Aug 2006 22:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For nonpure initial states, it is shown that well-defined\nholonomies can be assigned by using Uhlmann's concept of parallel transport\nalong the individual trajectories. We put forward an experimental realization\nof the geometric phase for a quantum trajectory in interferometry. We argue\nthat the average over the phase factors for all quantum trajectories that build\nup a given open system evolution, fails to reflect the geometry of the open\nsystem evolution itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Aug 2006 09:39:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
