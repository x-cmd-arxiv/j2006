This ratio constrains Galactic chemical\nevolution models to have a very small deuterium astration factor, the ratio of\nprimordial to total (D/H) ratio in the local region of the Galactic disk, which\nwe estimate to be f_d <= 1.19 +/-0.16 (1 sigma) or <= 1.12 +/- 0.14 (1 sigma)\ndepending on the adopted light element nuclear reaction rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2006 02:22:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

The standard \"collapsar\" model predicts\nthat a broad-lined and luminous Type Ic core-collapse supernova (SN)\naccompanies every long-duration GRB. This association has been confirmed in\nobservations of several nearby GRBs. Here we present observations of two nearby\nlong-duration GRBs that challenge this simple view. In the GRBs 060505 and\n060614 we demonstrate that no SN emission accompanied these long-duration\nbursts, down to limits hundreds of times fainter than the archetypal SN 1998bw\nthat accompanied GRB 980425, and fainter than any Type Ic SN ever observed.\nMulti-band observations of the early afterglows, as well as spectroscopy of the\nhost galaxies, exclude the possibility of significant dust obscuration and show\nthat the bursts originated in star-forming regions. The absence of a SN to such\ndeep limits is qualitatively different from all previous nearby long GRBs and\nsuggests a new phenomenological type of massive stellar death. From the\nsupplementary material: Now we have observed SN-less GRBs in star-forming\nregions, suggesting that a non-detection of a SN does not preclude a massive\nprogenitor. The position of the GRB, i.e. in a star-forming region or in an\nolder component, may be the only way to discriminate between merging compact\nobjects and massive stars as progenitors. In fact, several host galaxies for\nshort GRBs have been found to be as actively star-forming as some host galaxies\nof long-duration GRBs. The GRB labels \"long\" and \"short\" have become synonymous\nwith \"massive stars\" and \"other progenitors\". These distinctions may need to be\nrelaxed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2006 15:38:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Oct 2006 13:45:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 2007 08:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Combining it with the well-known\nrelation between the peak spectral energy and the isotropic equivalent energy\nof GRBs, we obtain an upper limit on the isotropic energy of GRBs, which is\n\\approx 10^{52} erg (L_{SN,peak}/10^{43} erg s^{-1})^{10}, where L_{SN,peak} is\nthe peak bolometric luminosity of the SNe.

Since it is generally believed that the peak\nluminosity of SNe powered by radioactive decays is related to the amount of\n56Ni produced in the SN explosion, the mass of 56Ni may be a key physical\nfactor for understanding the nature of GRBs and their connection with SNe.\nApplication of our relation to Type Ibc SNe with normal peak luminosities\nindicates that if those normal SNe have GRBs accompanying them, the GRBs would\nbe extremely soft and sub-energetic in gamma-rays, and hence easier to detect\nwith X-ray or UV detectors than with gamma-ray detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2006 14:16:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

An alpha-phase like electronic configuration of Ce is observed,\nwith ordered magnetic moments on the 4f and 5d electrons induced by the\ninteraction with Fe.

For a two hop parallel AF relay MAC,\nassuming a sum power constraint across all relays we characterize optimal relay\namplification factors and the resulting capacity regions. We find that the\nparallel AF relay MAC with total transmit power of the two users $P_1+P_2=P$\nand total relay power $P_R$ is the dual of the parallel AF relay BC where the\nMAC source nodes become the BC destination nodes, the MAC destination node\nbecomes the BC source node, the dual BC source transmit power is $P_R$ and the\ntotal transmit power of the AF relays is $P$. The duality means that the\ncapacity region of the AF relay MAC with a sum power constraint $P$ on the\ntransmitters is the same as that of the dual BC. The duality relationship is\nfound to be useful in characterizing the capacity region of the AF relay BC as\nthe union of MAC capacity regions. The duality extends to distributed relays\nwith multiple antennas and more than 2 hops as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2006 20:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

Here\nwe propose a related but different direct approach to problems of the calculus\nof variations and optimal control, which permit to obtain global minima\ndirectly, without recourse to needle variations and necessary conditions. Our\nmethod is inspired by the classical Noether's theorem and its recent extensions\nto optimal control. We make use of the variational symmetries of the problem,\nconsidering parameter-invariance transformations and substituting the original\nproblem by a parameter-family of optimal control problems. Parameters are then\nfixed in order to make the problem trivial, in some sense.

For\ntemporally symmetric neurons, every temporal cross-section of the STRF (impulse\nresponse) is given by the same function of time, except for a scaling and a\n\"Hilbert rotation\". This property held in 85% of neurons (123 out of 145)\nrecorded from awake animals, and in 96% of neurons (70 out of 73) recorded from\nanesthetized animals. This property of temporal symmetry is highly constraining\nfor possible models of functional neural connectivity within and into AI. We\nfind that the simplest models of functional thalamic input, from the ventral\nMedial Geniculate Body (MGB), into the entry layers of AI are ruled out because\nthey are incompatible with the constraints of the observed temporal symmetry.\nThis is also the case for the simplest models of functional intracortical\nconnectivity. Plausible models that do generate temporal symmetry, both from\nthalamic and intracortical inputs, are presented. In particular, we propose\nthat two specific characteristics of the thalamo-cortical interface may be\nresponsible. The first is a temporal mismatch between the fast dynamics of the\nthalamus and the slow responses of the cortex. The second is that all thalamic\ninputs into a cortical module (or a cluster of cells) must be restricted to one\npoint of entry (or one cell in the cluster). This latter property implies a\nlack of correlated horizontal interactions across cortical modules during the\nSTRF measurements. The implications of these insights in the auditory system,\nand comparisons with similar properties in the visual system, are explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Aug 2006 13:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
