At z~30-300, the intergalactic medium (IGM) is visible\nin 21 cm absorption against the cosmic microwave background (CMB), with a\nstrength that depends on the thermal (and ionization) history of the IGM. Here\nwe examine the constraints this background can place on dark matter decay and\nannihilation, which could heat and ionize the IGM through the production of\nhigh-energy particles. Using a simple model for dark matter decay, we show\nthat, if the decay energy is immediately injected into the IGM, the 21 cm\nbackground can detect energy injection rates >10^{-24} eV cm^{-3} sec^{-1}. If\nall the dark matter is subject to decay, this allows us to constrain dark\nmatter lifetimes <10^{27} sec. Such energy injection rates are much smaller\nthan those typically probed by the CMB power spectra. The expected brightness\ntemperature fluctuations at z~50 are a fraction of a mK and can vary from the\nstandard calculation by up to an order of magnitude, although the difference\ncan be significantly smaller if some of the decay products free stream to lower\nredshifts. For self-annihilating dark matter, the fluctuation amplitude can\ndiffer by a factor <2 from the standard calculation at z~50. Note also that, in\ncontrast to the CMB, the 21 cm probe is sensitive to both the ionization\nfraction and the IGM temperature, in principle allowing better constraints on\nthe decay process and heating history. We also show that strong IGM heating and\nionization can lead to an enhanced H_2 abundance, which may affect the earliest\ngenerations of stars and galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2006 20:14:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this paradigm Ia/c is\nproduced from the merger of two degenerate cores of common envelope WR stars,\nor of two CO white dwarfs. Its polar blowouts produce the observed high\nvelocity and polarized spectral features in Ia's, and its equatorial bulge is\nmuch brighter in Ia's, due to the greater fraction of 56Ni contained within it.\nThese become classified as Ia's when viewed from the merger equator, and Ic's\nwhen viewed from the poles, where a hypernova signature and a gamma-ray burst\n(GRB) will be observed for lines of sight close to the merger axis.

These predictions suffer from substantial\nrenormalization scheme dependence, which is illustrated using as an example the\nQCD effective charge appearing in the static interquark potential and the QCD\ncorrections to the Gross-Llewellyn-Smith sum rule in the deep inelastic\nneutrino-nucleon scattering. To reduce this scheme dependence, it is proposed\nto use a modified perturbation expansion, based on a modified couplant, which\nis perturbatively consistent with the conventional running coupling parameter,\nbut is free from Landau singularity and has smaller renormalization scheme\ndependence. The modified couplant is obtained by integrating the\nrenormalization group equation with an appropriately constructed nonpolynomial\ngenerator. The renormalization scheme dependence of the perturbative\npredictions in the modified expansion is discussed in detail, including the\npredictions selected by the Principle of Minimal Sensitivity. It is shown that\nthe modified predictions are much more stable with respect to change of the\nrenormalization scheme parameters than the predictions obtained in the\nconventional approach. It is also found that the modified predictions display\nsomewhat weaker energy dependence than the predictions obtained with the\nconventional expansion, which may be interesting from the point of view of\ncomparing the low energy and high energy determinations of the strong coupling\nparameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2006 00:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
