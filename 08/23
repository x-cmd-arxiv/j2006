To investigate the degree of sample incompleteness\nresulting from the X-ray based selection of the target clusters, we use a\nsample of 50 clusters with weak lensing mass measurements to empirically\ndetermine the relation between lensing mass and X-ray luminosity and the\nscatter about this relation. We use a complete, volume-limited sub-sample of 35\nX-ray luminous clusters of galaxies at 0.15<z<0.3 to constrain the abundance of\nvery massive (M >~ 10^15/h M_sun) clusters. From this, we constrain\nsigma_8(Omega_m/0.3)^{0.37} = 0.67^{+0.04}_{-0.05} (68% confidence limits),\nagreeing well with constraints from the 3-year WMAP CMB measurements and\nestimates of cluster abundances based on X-ray observations, but somewhat lower\nthan constraints from ``cosmic shear'' weak lensing measurements in random\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2006 12:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-02-06"}

It has been found\nthat 1E 1207.4-5209 is not spinning down monotonically suggesting that this\nneutron star undergoes strong, frequent glitches, contains a fall-back disk, or\npossess a binary companion. Here, we report on a sequence of seven XMM-Newton\nobservations of 1E 1207.4-5209 performed during a 40 day window in June/July\n2005.

The technique involves measurement of\nangle-dependent microwave magneto-conductivity and is, thus, closely related to\nthe cyclotron resonance and angle-dependent magnetoresistance techniques. Data\nfor three contrasting materials are presented: (TMTSF)2ClO4,\nalpha-(BEDT-TTF)2KHg(SCN)4 and kappa-(BEDT-TTF)2I3. These studies reveal\nimportant insights into the Fermiology of these novel materials, as well as\nproviding access to important electronic parameters such as the in-plane Fermi\nvelocity and quasiparticle scattering rate. It is argued that all three\ncompounds exhibit coherent three-dimensional band transport at liquid helium\ntemperatures, and that their low-energy magnetoelectrodynamic properties appear\nto be well explained on the basis of a conventional semiclassical Boltzmann\napproach. It is also suggested that this technique could be used to probe\nquasiparticles in nodal superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2006 19:26:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2006 20:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}

We develop schemes to optimize the\nratio, $\\rho(n)$ of achievable network sum capacity to the sum of the\npoint-to-point capacities of source-destinations pairs operating in isolation.\nFor fixed SNR networks, i.e., where the worst case SNR over the\nsource-destination pairs is fixed independent of $n$, we show that\ncollaborative strategies yield a scaling law of $\\rho(n) = {\\cal\nO}(\\frac{1}{n^{1/3}})$ in contrast to multi-hop strategies which yield a\nscaling law of $\\rho(n) = {\\cal O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}})$. While, networks where\nworst case SNR goes to zero, do not preclude the possibility of collaboration,\nmulti-hop strategies achieve optimal throughput. The plausible reason is that\nthe gains due to collaboration cannot offset the effect of vanishing receive\nSNR. This suggests that for fixed SNR networks, a network designer should look\nfor network protocols that exploit collaboration. The fact that most current\nnetworks operate in a fixed SNR interference limited environment provides\nfurther motivation for considering this regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2006 02:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

In the first part, we focus on the occurrence of KM algebras in the\ncosmological billiards. We analyse the billiards in the simplified situation of\nspatially homogeneous cosmologies. The most generic cases lead to the same\nalgebras as those met in the general inhomogeneous case, but also sub-algebras\nof the \"generic\" ones appear. Next, we consider particular gravitational\ntheories which, upon toroidal compactification to D=3 space-time dimensions,\nreduce to a theory of gravity coupled to a symmetric space non-linear\nsigma-model. We show that the billiard analysis gives direct information on\npossible dimensional oxidations (or on their obstructions) and field content of\nthe oxidation endpoint. We also consider all hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras and\ncompletely answer the question of whether or not a specific theory exists\nadmitting a billiard characterised by the given hyperbolic algebra. In the\nsecond part, we turn to the set up of such gravity-matter theories through the\nbuilding of an action explicitly invariant under a Kac-Moody group. As a first\nstep to include fermions, we check the compatibility of the presence of a Dirac\nfermion with the (hidden duality) symmetries appearing in the toroidal\ncompactification down to 3 space-time dimensions. Next, we investigate how the\nfermions (with spin 1/2 or 3/2) fit in the conjecture for hidden over-extended\nsymmetry G++. Finally, in the context of G+++ invariant actions, we derive all\nthe possible signatures for all the GB++ theories that can be obtained from the\nconventional one (1,D-1) by \"dualities\" generated by Weyl reflections.

This allows the generalization of the fermionic coherent states\napproach to such systems. Pseudo-fermionic coherent states are constructed as\neigenstates of two pseudo-fermion annihilation operators. These coherent states\nform a bi-normal and bi-overcomplete system, and their evolution governed by\nthe pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonian is temporally stable. In terms of the\nintroduced pseudo-fermion operators the two-level system' Hamiltonian takes a\nfactorized form similar to that of a harmonic oscillator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2006 12:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Feb 2009 10:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

It is found that the perfect balance between the contributions\nof vacuum fluctuations and radiation reaction that ensures the stability of\nground-state atoms is disturbed, making spontaneous transition of ground-state\natoms to excited states possible in vacuum with a conducting boundary. The\nboundary-induced contribution is effectively a nonthermal correction, which\nenhances or weakens the nonthermal effect already present in the unbounded\ncase, thus possibly making the effect easier to observe. An interesting feature\nworth being noted is that the nonthermal corrections may vanish for atoms on\nsome particular trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Aug 2006 14:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
