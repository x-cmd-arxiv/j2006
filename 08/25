In this study, the effect of anisotropy in\nneutrino emission from a proto-neutron star surface is examined with\nsemi-analytic neutrino-driven wind models. The increase of neutrino number\ndensity in the wind owing to the anisotropy is modeled schematically by\nenhancing the effective neutrino luminosity. It is shown that the neutrino\nheating rate from neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation into\nelectron-positron pairs can significantly increase owing to the anisotropy and\nplay a dominant role for the heating of wind material. A factor of five\nincrease in the effective neutrino luminosity results in 50% higher entropy and\na factor of ten shorter dynamic timescale owing to this enhanced neutrino\nheating. The nucleosynthesis calculations show that this change is enough for\nthe robust r-process, producing the third abundance peak A = 195 and beyond.\nFuture multi-dimensional studies with accurate neutrino transport will be\nneeded if such anisotropy relevant for the current scenario (more than a factor\nof a few) is realized during the wind phase (~1-10 s).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2006 03:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Non linear amplification of the error and\nbifurcation may limit the applicability of chemical models. Here we study such\neffects on dense cloud chemistry. Method: Using a previously studied approach\nto uncertainties based on the representation of rate coefficient errors as log\nnormal distributions, we attempted to apply our approach using as input a\nvariety of different elemental abundances from those studied previously. In\nthis approach, all rate coefficients are varied randomly within their log\nnormal (Gaussian) distribution, and the time-dependent chemistry calculated\nanew many times so as to obtain good statistics for the uncertainties in the\ncalculated abundances. Results: Starting with so-called ``high-metal''\nelemental abundances, we found bimodal rather than Gaussian like distributions\nfor the abundances of many species and traced these strange distributions to an\nextreme sensitivity of the system to changes in the ratio of the cosmic ray\nionization rate zeta\\_He for He and that for molecular hydrogen zeta\\_H2. The\nsensitivity can be so extreme as to cause a region of bistability, which was\nsubsequently found to be more extensive for another choice of elemental\nabundances.

It\nthus makes sense to require an underlying clock synchronization mechanism to be\nhighly fault-tolerant. A self-stabilizing algorithm seeks to attain\nsynchronization once lost; a Byzantine algorithm assumes synchronization is\nnever lost and focuses on containing the influence of the permanent presence of\nfaulty nodes. There are efficient self-stabilizing solutions for clock\nsynchronization as well as efficient solutions that are resilient to Byzantine\nfaults. In contrast, to the best of our knowledge there is no practical\nsolution that is self-stabilizing while tolerating the permanent presence of\nByzantine nodes.

In classic Byzantine algorithms this is fulfilled or aided by\nhaving the clocks initially close to each other and thus the actual clock\nvalues can be used for synchronizing the events.

Several papers asserting to\nhave proven this large N ``orientifold equivalence'' have appeared. By\nconsidering theories compactified on $R^3 \\times S^1$, we show explicitly that\nthis large N equivalence fails for sufficiently small radius, where our\nanalysis is reliable, due to spontaneous symmetry breaking of charge\nconjugation symmetry in QCD with an antisymmetric (or symmetric) tensor\nrepresentation fermion.

Unfortunately, for regular underlying\nintensities, decimation yields discontinuous estimates and strong \"staircase\"\nartifacts. In this paper, we propose to combine the HT framework with the\ndecimated biorthogonal Haar (Bi-Haar) transform instead of the classical Haar.\nThe Bi-Haar filter bank is normalized such that the p-values of Bi-Haar\ncoefficients (pBH) provide good approximation to those of Haar (pH) for\nhigh-intensity settings or large scales; for low-intensity settings and small\nscales, we show that pBH are essentially upper-bounded by pH. Thus, we may\napply the Haar-based HTs to Bi-Haar coefficients to control a prefixed false\npositive rate. By doing so, we benefit from the regular Bi-Haar filter bank to\ngain a smooth estimate while always maintaining a low computational complexity.\nA Fisher-approximation-based threshold imple- menting the HTs is also\nestablished.

These calculations are in\nexcellent agreement with experimental measurements. This effect has to be\nunderstood in terms of the properties exhibited by the dielectric constant of\nmetals which cannot be treated as ideal metals for the purpose of transmission\nand diffraction of light. We discuss the cases of well-differentiated metals\nsilver and tungsten. It is found that the effect of surface plasmons or other\nsurface wave excitations due to a periodical set of holes or other roughness at\nthe surface is marginal. The effect can enhance but also can depress the\ntransmission of the arrays as shown by theory and experiments. The peak\nstructure observed in experiments is a consequence of the interference of the\nwavefronts transmitted by each hole and is determined by the surface array\nperiod independently of the material. Without large transmission through a\nsingle hole there is no large transmission through the array. We found that in\nthe case of Ag which at the discussed frequencies is a metal there are\ncylindrical plasmons at the wall of the hole, as reported by Economu et al 30\nyears ago, that enhanced the transmission. But it turns out, as will be\nexplained, that for the case of W which behaves as a dielectric, there is also\na large transmission when compared with that of an ideal metal waveguide. To\ndeal with this problem one has to use the measured dielectric function of the\nmetals. We discuss thoroughly all these cases and compare with the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2006 18:17:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The evolution of\nthe phase state of the wire material during explosion was examined by means of\none-dimensional numerical simulation using a semiempirical wide-range equation\nof state describing the properties of tungsten with allowance made for melting\nand vaporization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2006 13:25:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The total\nenergy of the heteropolymer is determined by the repulsive/attractive\ninteractions of non-linked beads and the contribution from the dihedral angles\ninvolved. Their parameters can be rigorously defined, unlike the ill defined\nsurface tension of a cluster of protein residues which is the basis of the\nprevious model. As a crucial idea of the model, the dihedral potential in which\na selected bead is involved is averaged over all possible configurations of\nneighboring beads along the protein chain. The resulting average dihedral\npotential of the residue is constant far enough from the cluster, but increases\nmonotonically with decreasing distance below a threshold value. An overall\npotential around the cluster wherein a residue performs a chaotic motion is a\ncombination of the average dihedral and pairwise potentials. As a function of\ndistance from the cluster it has a double well shape. Residues in the inner\nwell are considered as belonging to the cluster (folded part of the protein)\nwhile those in the outer well are treated as belonging to the unfolded\n(although compact) part of the protein. A double well shape of the potential\naround the cluster allows one to determine its emission and absorption rates by\nusing a first passage time analysis and develop a self-consistent kinetic\ntheory for the nucleation mechanism of protein folding. Numerical calculations\nfor a protein of 2500 residues with the diffusion coefficient of residues in\nthe native state ranging from 10^{-6} cm^2/s to 10^{-8} cm^2/s predict folding\ntimes in the range from several seconds to several hundreds of seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Aug 2006 13:45:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Due to the inclusion of atomic vibrational motion, the atom-field\ncoupling becomes highly nonlinear what brings out quite different behaviors for\nthe system dynamics when compared to the ordinary TPJCM.
