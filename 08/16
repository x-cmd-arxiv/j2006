We present the detailed analysis of the\nMHD waves, the cylindrical radial force balance, and the collimation of\nmagnetic tower jets. As magnetic energy is injected into a small central volume\nover a finite amount of time, the magnetic fields expand down the background\ndensity gradient, forming a collimated jet and an expanded ``lobe'' due to the\ngradually decreasing background density and pressure. Both the jet and lobes\nare magnetically dominated. In addition, the injection and expansion produce a\nhydrodynamic shock wave that is moving ahead of and enclosing the magnetic\ntower jet. This shock can eventually break the hydrostatic equilibrium in the\nambient medium and cause a global gravitational contraction. This contraction\nproduces a strong compression at the head of the magnetic tower front and helps\nto collimate radially to produce a slender-shaped jet. At the outer edge of the\njet, the magnetic pressure is balanced by the background (modified) gas\npressure, without any significant contribution from the hoop stress. On the\nother hand, along the central axis of the jet, hoop stress is the dominant\nforce in shaping the central collimation of the poloidal current.

This physical association then leads to the suggestion that the\nredshifts of quasars are not really an indication of their distances.

Based on the proposed\nlocal-ether theory, this intrinsic redshift is determined solely by the\ngravitational potential associated specifically with the celestial object in\nwhich the emitting sources are placed. During the process with which quasars\nevolve into ordinary galaxies, the fragmentation of quasars and the formation\nof stars occur and hence the masses of quasars decrease. Thus their\ngravitational potentials and hence redshifts become smaller and smaller. This\nis in accord with the aging of redshift during the evolution process. In some\nobservations, the redshifts of quasars have been found to follow the Karlsson\nformula to exhibit a series of preferred peaks in their distributions.

However, despite the importance of Bell inequalities, it is not\nknown in general how to determine whether a given entangled state will violate\na Bell inequality. This is because one can choose to make many different\nmeasurements on a quantum system to test any given Bell inequality and the\noptimization over measurements is a high-dimensional variational problem. In\norder to better understand this problem we present algorithms that provide, for\na given quantum state, both a lower bound and an upper bound on the maximal\nexpectation value of a Bell operator. Both bounds apply techniques from convex\noptimization and the methodology for creating upper bounds allows them to be\nsystematically improved. In many cases these bounds determine measurements that\nwould demonstrate violation of the Bell inequality or provide a bound that\nrules out the possibility of a violation. Examples are given to illustrate how\nthese algorithms can be used to conclude definitively if some quantum states\nviolate a given Bell inequality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2006 10:57:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Apr 2007 06:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
