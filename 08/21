Early Chandra observations have shown that the most massive star\nsystem in the Orion Trapezium Cluster, theta2 Ori A, shows rapid variability on\ntime scales of hours. We determine X-ray fluxes and find that the star shows\nvery strong variability over the last 5 years. We observed a second large X-ray\noutburst in November 2004 with the high resolution transmission grating\nspectrometer on-board Chandra.

In the high state we find an extended emissivity\ndistribution with high emissivities in the range from 3 MK to over 100 MK. The\noutburst event in stellar terms is one of the most powerful ever observed and\nthe most energetic one in the ONC with a lower total energy limit of 1.5x10^37\nergs. The line diagnostics show that under the assumption that the line\nemitting regions in the low states are as close as within 1 -- 2 stellar radii\nfrom the O-star's photosphere, whereas the hard states suggest a distance of 3\n-- 5 stellar radii. The two outbursts are very close to the periastron passage\nof the stars. We argue that the high X-ray states are possibly the result of\nreconnection events from magnetic interactions of the primary and secondary\nstars of the spectroscopic binary. Effects from wind collisions seem unlikely\nfor this system. The low state emissivity and R-ratios strengthen the\npredicament that the X-ray emission is enhanced by magnetic confinement of the\nprimary wind.

Neglect of\nfluctuation contributions to this gaussian model yields a mean-field theory\nthat produces useless results. A refinement that accounts for\nsharper-than-gaussian behavior at high binding energies recognizes\ncontributions from a discrete number of water molecules and permits a natural\nmatching of numerically exact results. These gaussian models, which can be\nunderstood as vigorous simplifications of quasi-chemical theories, are\napplicable to aqueous environments where the utility of structural models based\non geometrical considerations of water hydrogen bonding have not been\nestablished.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2006 13:36:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This semiclassical broadcasting\nprotocol is more restrictive than a general one, since it requires an\nintermediate step where classical information is extracted and processed.\nHowever, we prove that a suboptimal superbroadcasting, namely broadcasting with\nsimultaneous purification of the local output states with respect to the input\nones, is possible. We show that in the asymptotic limit of $M \\to \\infty$ the\npurification rate converges to the optimal one, proving the conjecture that\noptimal broadcasting and state estimation are asymptotically equivalent. We\nalso show that it is possible to achieve superbroadcasting with simultaneous\ninversion of the Bloch vector direction (universal NOT). We prove that in this\ncase the semiclassical procedure of state estimation and preparation turns out\nto be optimal. We finally analyse semiclassical superbroadcasting in the\nphase-covariant case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Aug 2006 16:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
