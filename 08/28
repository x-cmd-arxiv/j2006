In\ncertain circumstances, Fokker-Planck evolution also describes the evolution of\ndark (invisible) matter in the universe.

The\nresulting dissipation imprints a minimum length scale for cosmic density\nfluctuations. Still later, these density fluctuations produce stochastic\ngravitational forces on the dark matter as it begins to cluster under gravity.\nThe latter example provides an exact derivation of the Fokker-Planck equation\nwithout the usual assumption of Markovian dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2006 00:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Low effective yields in\ngalaxies with rotation speeds < 120 km/s have been widely interpreted as the\nonset of SN-driven winds below a characteristic galaxy mass, but gas accretion\nis also a viable explanation. However, calculations presented here prove: (1)\nthat metal-enriched outflows are the only mechanism that can significantly\nreduce the effective yield, but only for gas-rich systems; (2) that it is\nnearly impossible to reduce the effective yield of a gas-poor system, no matter\nhow much gas is lost or accreted; and (3) that any subsequent star formation\ndrives the effective yield back to the closed-box value. Thus, only gas-rich\nsystems with low star formation rates (such as dwarf irregulars) can produce\nand maintain low effective yields, while massive gas-poor galaxies can never\nshow low effective yields, even after experiencing substantial infall and/or\noutflow. The drop in effective yield seen in low mass galaxies is therefore\nless likely to be due to the onset of SN-driven winds than to the galaxies'\nsurface densities falling entirely below the Kennicutt SF threshold. Additional\ncalculations confirm that the fraction of baryonic mass lost through winds\nvaries only weakly with galaxy mass, shows no sharp upturn at any mass scale,\nand does not require that >15% of baryons have been lost by galaxies of any\nmass. SN feedback is therefore unlikely to be effective for removing large\namounts of gas from low mass disk galaxies. In addition, the dependence between\nmetal-loss and galaxy mass is sufficiently weak that massive galaxies dominate\nmetal enrichment of the IGM.

Many transit surveys are now under way, with instruments ranging from\n10-cm cameras to the Hubble Space Telescope. However, the results of these\nsurveys have been much below the expected capacity, estimated in the dozens of\ndetections per year. One of the reasons is the presence of systematics (``red\nnoise'') in photometric time series. In general, yield predictions assume\nuncorrelated noise (``white noise''). In this paper, we show that the effect of\nred noise on the detection threshold and the expected yields cannot be\nneglected in typical ground-based surveys. We develop a simple method to\ndetermine the effect of red noise on photometric planetary transit detections.\nThis method can be applied to determine detection thresholds for transit\nsurveys. We show that the detection threshold in the presence of systematics\ncan be much higher than with the assumption of white noise, and obeys a\ndifferent dependence on magnitude, orbital period and the parameters of the\nsurvey. Our method can also be used to estimate the significance level of a\nplanetary transit candidate (to select promising candidates for spectroscopic\nfollow-up). We apply our method to the OGLE planetary transit search, and show\nthat it provides a reliable description of the actual detectionthreshold with\nreal correlated noise.

Next, we introduce a definition of {\\it quasi associated homogeneous\ndistributions} and provide a mathematical description of all quasi associated\nhomogeneous distributions and their Fourier transform. It is proved that the\nclass of {\\it quasi associated homogeneous distributions} coincides with the\nclass of distributions introduced by Gel$'$fand and Shilov \\cite[Ch.I,\\S\n4.]{G-Sh} as the class of {\\it associated homogeneous distributions}. For the\nmultidimensional case it is proved that $f$ is a {\\it quasi associated\nhomogeneous distribution} if and only if it satisfies the Euler type system of\ndifferential equations. A new type of $\\Gamma$-functions generated by quasi\nassociated homogeneous distributions is defined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2006 19:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Although this\nensemble consists of products of quasi-classical states, it exhibits some\nquantum nonlocality. This remarkable effect is demonstrated experimentally by\nimplementing the optimal local strategy together with a joint nonlocal strategy\nthat yields a higher fidelity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Aug 2006 13:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
