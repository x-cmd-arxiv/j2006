In\nboth cases the binaries complete almost two orbits before merging. We find\nthat, during these last orbits, the specific spin (a/m) of each horizon\nincreases by only 0.012 for the initially non-spinning configuration, and by\nonly 0.006 for the initially corotating configuration. By contrast, the\ncorotation value for the specific spin should increase from 0.1 at the initial\nproper separation of 10M to 0.33 when the proper separation is 5M. Thus the\nspin-orbit coupling is far too weak to tidally lock the binary to a corotating\nstate during the late-inspiral phase. We also study the converse transfer from\nspin into orbital motion. In this case, we start the simulations with parallel,\nhighly-spinning non-boosted black holes. As the collision proceeds, the system\nacquires a non-head-on orbital motion, due to spin-orbit coupling, that leads\nto the radiation of angular momentum.

We show that the theory of laser\nbeams is successful in characterizing radiation fields associated with any SR\nsource. Both radiation beam generated by an ultra-relativistic electron in a\nmagnetic device and laser beam are solutions of the wave equation based on\nparaxial approximation. It follows that they are similar in all aspects. In the\nspace-frequency domain SR beams appear as laser beams whose transverse extents\nare large compared with the wavelength. In practical situations (e.g.\nundulator, bending magnet sources), radiation beams exhibit a virtual \"waist\"\nwhere the wavefront is often plane. Remarkably, the field distribution of a SR\nbeam across the waist turns out to be strictly related with the inverse Fourier\ntransform of the far-field angle distribution. Then, we take advantage of\nstandard Fourier Optics techniques and apply the Fresnel propagation formula to\ncharacterize the SR beam. Altogether, we show that it is possible to\nreconstruct the near-field distribution of the SR beam outside the magnetic\nsetup from the knowledge of the far-field pattern. The general theory of SR in\nthe near-zone developed in this paper is illustrated for the special cases of\nundulator radiation, edge radiation and transition undulator radiation. Using\nknown analytical formulas for the far-field pattern and its inverse Fourier\ntransform we find analytical expressions for near-field distributions in terms\nof far-field distributions. Finally, we compare these expressions with\nincorrect or incomplete literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Aug 2006 14:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
