We take care to explore cosmologically\nrelevant orbital parameters and to set up realistic initial galaxy models that\ninclude all three relevant dynamical components: dark matter halos, stellar\nbulges, and central massive black holes. The effects of several different\nparameters are considered, including orbital energy and angular momentum,\nsatellite density and inner density profile, satellite-to-host mass ratio, and\npresence of a black hole at the center of the host. Black holes play a crucial\nrole in protecting the shallow stellar cores of the hosts, as satellites\nmerging onto a host with a central black hole are more strongly disrupted than\nthose merging onto hosts without black holes. Orbital parameters play an\nimportant role in determining the degree of disruption: satellites on less\nbound or more eccentric orbits are more easily destroyed than those on more\nbound or more circular orbits as a result of an increased number of pericentric\npassages and greater cumulative effects of gravitational shocking and tidal\nstripping. In addition, satellites with densities typical of faint elliptical\ngalaxies are disrupted relatively easily, while denser satellites can survive\nmuch better in the tidal field of the host. Over the range of parameters\nexplored, we find that the accretion of a single satellite elliptical galaxy\ncan result in a broad variety of changes, in both signs, in the surface\nbrightness profile and color of the central part of an elliptical galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2006 19:55:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Nov 2006 18:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The MOJAVE sample comprises 133\nradio-loud flat-spectrum AGN with compact relativistic outflows detected at\nparsec scales. The source counts of compact AGN shows that the MOJAVE sample\nrepresents a flux-limited complete sample. Analysis of the population of\nflat-spectrum quasars of the sample reveals that the pc-scale jets of quasars\nhave intrinsic luminosities in the range between ~10^24 W/Hz and ~10^27 W/Hz\nand Lorentz factors distributed between 3 and 30. We find that the apparent\nspeed (or Lorentz factor) of jets evolves with redshift, increasing from z~0 to\nz~1 and then falling at higher redshifts (z~2.5) by a factor of 2.5. The\nevolution of apparent speeds does not affect significantly the evolution of the\nbeamed luminosity function of quasars, which is most likely to be dependent on\nthe evolution of radio luminosity. Furthermore, the beamed radio luminosity\nfunction suggests that the intrinsic luminosity function of quasars has a\ndouble power-law form: it is flat at low luminosities and steep at high\nluminosities. There is a positive evolution of quasars at low redshifts (z<0.5)\nand strong negative evolution at redshifts >1.7 with space density decline up\nto z~2.5. This implies that the powerful jets were more populous at redshifts\nbetween 0.5 and 1.7.

The model is\ndefined in a lattice whose sites represent the possible states of the metal\n(bulk, reactive and passive) and the solution (neutral, acidic or basic).\nProbabilistic rules describe passivation of the metal surface, dissolution of\nthe passive layer, which is enhanced in acidic media, and spatially separated\nelectrochemical reactions, which may create pH inhomogeneities in the solution.\n  From a suitable matching of characteristic times of creation and annihilation\nof pH inhomogeneities in the solution, a scaling theory gives the average\nradius of the dissolved region at the incubation time as a function of the\nmodel parameters. That radius decreases with the rate of spatially separated\nreactions and the rate of dissolution in acidic media, and increases with the\ndiffusion coefficient of H+ and OH- ions in solution. The average incubation\ntime is written as the sum of a series of characteristic times for the slow\ndissolution in neutral media.

This\nso-called ``forbidden zone'' (FZ) suggests the existence of a persistent\ncross-shelf transport barrier on the southern portion of the WFS. In this\nletter a year-long record of surface currents produced by a Hybrid-Coordinate\nOcean Model simulation of the WFS is used to identify Lagrangian coherent\nstructures (LCSs), which reveal the presence of a robust and persistent\ncross-shelf transport barrier in approximately the same location as the\nboundary of the FZ.

In the pulsed case, atoms with a given\nenergy are transferred into untrapped dressed states by abruptly switching off\nthe interaction. In the continuous case, it is possible for energetic atoms to\nadiabatically follow the doubly-dressed states and escape out of the trap. Our\nresults also show that when the frequencies of the fields RF1 and RF2 are\nseparated by at least the Rabi frequency associated with RF1, additional\nevaporation zones appear which can make this process more efficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Aug 2006 09:41:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2006 14:27:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Sep 2006 21:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Contrary to what is\ncommon in models of repeated games in the literature, most real situations may\ndiffer a lot and they are seldom completely symmetric. The purpose of this\npaper is to discuss a simple model of cognitive processing in the context of a\nrepeated interaction with varying payoffs. The interaction between players is\nmodelled by a repeated game with random observable payoffs. Cooperation is not\nsimply associated with a certain action but needs to be understood as a\nphenomenon of the behaviour in the repeated game. The players are thus faced\nwith a more complex situation, compared to the Prisoner's Dilemma that has been\nwidely used for investigating the conditions for cooperation in evolving\npopulations. Still, there are robust cooperating strategies that usually evolve\nin a population of players. In the cooperative mode, these strategies select an\naction that allows for maximizing the sum of the payoff of the two players in\neach round, regardless of the own payoff. Two such players maximise the\nexpected total long-term payoff. If the opponent deviates from this scheme, the\nstrategy invokes a punishment action, which aims at lowering the opponent's\nscore for the rest of the (possibly infinitely) repeated game. The introduction\nof mistakes to the game actually pushes evolution towards more cooperative\nstrategies even though the game becomes more difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2006 16:38:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
