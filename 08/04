An inverse-square-law force of this kind would manifest itself as a\nviolation of the equivalence principle in the dynamics of CDM compared to\nbaryons in the form of gas or stars.

The acoustic eigenmodes are directly sensitive to this mean\nmagnetic energy, via the magnetic pressure, and thanks to their trajectories\nsweeping entirely this region. We use the local-wave formalism to calculate the\np-mode frequencies of the Saclay seismic solar model. Then, by comparing them\nto the LOWL observed frequencies, the l-independent differences (up to 40\nmicroHz) can be attributed to the existence of a magnetic pressure that\nmodifies the pressure, the density and the sound speed, taking also into\naccount the additional Alfven speed.

This change presents two distinctive parts: a plateau of only\n2-3 G from the surface down to 2100 km, and a very narrow peak of 55 G, 220 km\nthick, right at the surface. Due to the non-linear effect of the magnetic\nfield, comparing only the frequencies between minimum and maximum activity is\nnot sufficient to deduce the magnetic variation.

Screening of this pseudo-spin,\ntogether with the real spin, can result in an SU(4) Kondo effect at low\ntemperatures.

The dynamics studied is a simple Langevin\ndynamics commonly referred to as the Rouse model. The equations for the\ntwo-time correlation and response function are derived within the gaussian\nvariational approximation. In order to implement this approximation faithfully,\nwe employ the supersymmetric representation of the Martin-Siggia-Rose dynamical\naction. For a short ranged correlated random potential the equations are solved\nanalytically in the limit of large times using certain assumptions concerning\nthe asymptotic behavior. Two possible dynamical behaviors are identified\ndepending upon the time separation- a stationary regime and an aging regime. In\nthe stationary regime time translation invariance holds and so is the\nfluctuation dissipation theorem. The aging regime which occurs for large time\nseparations of the two-time correlation functions is characterized by history\ndependence and the breakdown of certain equilibrium relations. The large time\nlimit of the equations yields equations among the order parameters that are\nsimilar to the equations obtained in the statics using replicas. In particular\nthe aging solution corresponds to the broken replica solution. But there is a\ndifference in one equation that leads to important consequences for the\nsolution. The stationary regime corresponds to the motion of the polymer inside\na local minimum of the random potential, whereas in the aging regime the\npolymer hops between different minima.

In this work, by developing a general\nmethod of computing the perihelion advance via the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector\neven for non-separable Hamiltonians, I show that the precession error in\nsymplectic integrators can be computed analytically. It is found that at each\norder, each paired error Hamiltonians cause the orbit to precess oppositely by\nexactly the same amount after each period. Hence, symplectic corrector, or\nprocess integrators, which have equal coefficients for these paired error\nterms, will have their precession errors exactly cancel after each period.

The characterization of their fluxes is\nsubject, however, to rather large and highly correlated uncertainties. The\ngeochemical covariance of the U, Th and K abundances in various Earth\nreservoirs induces positive correlations among the associated geo-neutrino\nfluxes, and between these and the radiogenic heat. Mass-balance constraints in\nthe Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) tend instead to anti-correlate the radiogenic\nelement abundances in complementary reservoirs. Experimental geo-neutrino\nobservables may be further (anti)correlated by instrumental effects. In this\ncontext, we propose a systematic approach to covariance matrices, based on the\nfact that all the relevant geo-neutrino observables and constraints can be\nexpressed as linear functions of the U, Th and K abundances in the Earth's\nreservoirs (with relatively well-known coefficients).

We use then the GNSM to make predictions about several\nexperiments (\"forward approach\"), and to show how future data can constrain - a\nposteriori - the error matrix of the model itself (\"backward approach\").

Although, no conclusive experimental evidence have so far\nbeen found but the subject is still of much interest to physicist. The theory\nof magnetic monopoles was first proposed by Dirac in 1931 and soon after it was\nstudied by physicist of many deciplines specially particle physics, quantum\nfield theory and non-linear Soliton equations. One important consequence of the\nmagnetic monopole theory is the quantization of the electric charge which was\nfirst derived by Dirac. In the definition of the classicaql magnetic monopole,\nthe concept of Dirac string is used. dirac string is the locus of the points\nwhere the vector potential is nopt well-behave. On the other hand by\nintroducing the idea of magnetic monopoles, Maxwell's equations became\nsymmetrical with respect to the magnetic and electric fields, but they still\nremain unsymmetrical as far as the scalar and the vector potentials are\nconcerned. In this work the electric and magnetic fields are redifined in\ntermes of some new scalar and vector potentials, respectively, as a result of\nwhich the Maxwell's equations become symmetrical with respect to the\npotentials, too. One advantage of using this formulation is that one can\ndiscard the Dirac string all together. Finally, definition of the new\npotentials guarantees the lorentz invariance of equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Aug 2006 13:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-11-12"}
