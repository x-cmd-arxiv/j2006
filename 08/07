Recently, several authors have proposed a secure\npositioning mechanism of mobile terminals which is based on the geometric\nproperty of wireless node placement, and on the postulate of modern physics\nthat a propagation speed of information never exceeds the velocity of light. In\nparticular, they utilize the measurements of the round-trip time of radio\nsignal propagation and bidirectional communication for variants of the\nchallenge-and-response. In this paper, we propose a novel means to construct\nthe above mechanism by use of unidirectional communication instead of\nbidirectional communication. Our proposal is based on the assumption that a\nmobile terminal incorporates a high-precision inner clock in a tamper-resistant\nprotected area. In positioning, the mobile terminal uses its inner clock and\nthe time and location information broadcasted by radio from trusted stations.\nOur proposal has a major advantage in protecting the location privacy of mobile\nterminal users, because the mobile terminal need not provide any information to\nthe trusted stations through positioning procedures. Besides, our proposal is\nfree from the positioning error due to claimant's processing-time fluctuations\nin the challenge-and-response, and is well-suited for mobile terminals in the\nopen air, or on the move at high speed, in terms of practical usage. We analyze\nthe security, the functionality, and the feasibility of our proposal in\ncomparison to previous proposals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2006 05:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The basic idea is that\nthe H{\\\"o}lder exponent for a sufficiently long sequence of uncorrelated random\nnumbers has the fixed value $h=1/2$. The presence of long-range correlations\nleads to deviation from this value. We calculate the H{\\\"o}lder exponent by the\nmethod of multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA). We discuss\nfrequently used tests for randomness, finite sample properties of the MFDFA,\nand the conditions for a correct application of the method. We observe that the\nfluctuation function $F_{q}$ used in the MFDFA reacts to trends caused by low\nperiodicity presented in the pseudo-random number generator. In order to select\nappropriate generators from the numerous programs we propose a test for the\nensemble properties of the generated pseudo-random sequences with respect to\ntheir robustness against presence of long-range correlations, and a selection\nrule which orders the generators that pass the test. Selecting generators that\nsuccessfully pass the ensemble test and have good performance with respect to\nthe selection rule is not enough. For the selected generator we have to choose\nappropriate pseudo-random sequences for the length of the sequence required by\nthe solved problem. This choice is based on the closeness of the H{\\\"o}lder\nexponent of the generated sequence to its value 1/2 characteristic for the case\nof absence of correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Aug 2006 15:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

One of the main results of the previous study is that there are\nmodes of dynamic behaviour, such as limit cycles and fixed points, that are\nmaintained due to a non-zero mutation level, resulting in a significantly\nhigher level of cooperation than was reported in earlier studies. In the\npresent study, we investigate two mechanisms in the evolutionary dynamics for\nfinite populations: (i) a stochastic model of the mutation process, and (ii) a\nstochastic model of the selection process.
