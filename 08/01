The origin of this reentrance\ncan be traced back to the normalization of the coupling strength. In the second\npart we consider a system of oscillators with an initial gradient in their\nnatural frequencies, extended over a one-dimensional chain or a two-dimensional\nlattice. Here it is the oscillator with the highest natural frequency that\nbecomes the pacemaker of the ensemble, sending out circular waves in\noscillator-phase space. No asymmetric coupling between the oscillators is\nneeded for this dynamical induction of the pacemaker property nor need it be\ndistinguished by a gap in the natural frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2006 13:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-18"}

The corresponding\nrelativistic diffusion propagator is obtained directly from the nonrelativistic\nWiener propagator, by rewriting the latter in terms of an integral over\nactions. The resulting relativistic process is non-Markovian, in accordance\nwith the known fact that nontrivial continuous, relativistic Markov processes\nin position space cannot exist.

The\nnon-linear perturbations obey inhomogeneous partial differential equations,\nwhere the structure of the differential operator is given by the previous\nperturbative orders and the source terms are quadratic in the first order\nperturbations.

In studies of ``functional\ndata analysis,'' it has often been assumed that a sample of random functions is\nobserved precisely, in the continuum and without noise. While this has been the\ntraditional setting for functional data analysis, in the context of\nlongitudinal data analysis a random function typically represents a patient, or\nsubject, who is observed at only a small number of randomly distributed points,\nwith nonnegligible measurement error. Nevertheless, essentially the same\nmethods can be used in both these cases, as well as in the vast number of\nsettings that lie between them. How is performance affected by the sampling\nplan? In this paper we answer that question. We show that if there is a sample\nof $n$ functions, or subjects, then estimation of eigenvalues is a\nsemiparametric problem, with root-$n$ consistent estimators, even if only a few\nobservations are made of each function, and if each observation is encumbered\nby noise. However, estimation of eigenfunctions becomes a nonparametric problem\nwhen observations are sparse. The optimal convergence rates in this case are\nthose which pertain to more familiar function-estimation settings. We also\ndescribe the effects of sampling at regularly spaced points, as opposed to\nrandom points. In particular, it is shown that there are often advantages in\nsampling randomly. However, even in the case of noisy data there is a threshold\nsampling rate (depending on the number of functions treated) above which the\nrate of sampling (either randomly or regularly) has negligible impact on\nestimator performance, no matter whether eigenfunctions or eigenvectors are\nbeing estimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2006 12:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}

The Hamiltonian is\ngeneric in that it represents a host of entanglement mechanisms, which can thus\nbe treated in a unified way. We start by solving the quantum dynamics\nanalytically when the system is initially in a Fock state. We show how the two\nmodes get entangled by evolution to produce a coherent superposition of vortex\nstates in general, and a single vortex state under certain conditions. The\ndegree of entanglement between the modes is measured by finding the explicit\nanalytical dependence of the Von Neumann entropy on the system parameters. The\nreduced state of each mode is analyzed by means of its correlation function and\nspatial coherence function. Remarkably, our analysis is shown to be equally as\nvalid for a variety of initial states that can be prepared from a two-mode Fock\nstate via a unitary transformation and for which the results can be obtained by\nmere inspection of the corresponding results for an initial Fock state. As an\nexample, we consider a quantum vortex as the initial state and also find\nconditions for its revival and charge conjugation. While studying the evolution\nof the initial vortex state, we have encountered and explained an interesting\nsituation in which the entropy of the system does not evolve whereas its wave\nfunction does. Although the modal concept has been used throughout the paper,\nit is important to note that the theory is equally applicable for a\ntwo-particle system in which each particle is represented by its bosonic\ncreation and annihilation operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Jul 2006 16:43:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

However, the use of\nfemtosecond pump pulses to generate multi-photon states with precise timing\noften requires spectral filtering to maintain a high quality of polarization\nentanglement. This typically reduces the efficiency of photon pair collection.\nWe experimentally map the polarization correlations of photon pairs from such a\nsource over a range of down-converted wavelengths with a high spectral\nresolution and find strong polarization correlations everywhere. A spectrally\ndependent imbalance between contributions from the two possible decay paths of\nSPDC is identified as the reason for a reduction in entanglement quality\nobserved with femtosecond pump pulses. Our spectral measurements allow to\npredict the polarization correlations for arbitrary filter profiles when the\nfrequency degree of freedom of the photon pairs is ignored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2006 11:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We use tools from these three fields to analyze problems that arise in\nthe interdisciplinary intersection. More concretely, in Chapter 1 we consider\nthe irreversibility of renormalization group flows from a quantum information\nperspective by using majorization theory and conformal field theory. In Chapter\n2 we compute the entanglement of a single copy of a bipartite quantum system\nfor a variety of models by using techniques from conformal field theory and\nToeplitz matrices. The entanglement entropy of the so-called\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model is computed in Chapter 3, showing analogies with\nthat of (1+1)-dimensional quantum systems. In Chapter 4 we apply the ideas of\nscaling of quantum correlations in quantum phase transitions to the study of\nquantum algorithms, focusing on Shor's factorization algorithm and quantum\nalgorithms by adiabatic evolution solving an NP-complete and the searching\nproblems. Also, in Chapter 5 we use techniques originally inspired by\ncondensed-matter physics to develop classical simulations, using the so-called\nmatrix product states, of an adiabatic quantum algorithm. Finally, in Chapter 6\nwe consider the behavior of some families of quantum algorithms from the\nperspective of majorization theory. The structure within each Chapter is such\nthat the last section always summarizes the basic results. Some general\nconclusions and possible future directions are briefly discussed in Chapter 7.\nAppendix A, Appendix B and Appendix C respectively deal with some basic notions\non majorization theory, conformal field theory, and classical complexity\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2006 15:50:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
