We focus\non the event 6 of 6.3 MeV and also on the other events that at 1 sigma fall\nbelow the energy threshold: events 3,4,10,12. The volume distribution is not a\nuniform distribution at 3 sigma, that suggests the presence of background\nevents close or at the border of the volume used for the analysis, including\nthe events 3,4,10. We checked the expected energy distribution assuming that\nthe signal is due to nubar(e)p-->e+n and that the average antineutrino energy\nis 14 MeV. The agreement with the observations is not perfect but it is\nacceptable at the 11 % confidence level if we include the peak of low energy\nbackground events; otherwise, we face a 2.9 sigma problem. The expected energy\ndistribution implies that the evidence for supernova neutrinos is at 10 sigma\nand that 1-3 background events are plausible. This conclusion does not change\nstrongly when we model the time distribution of the signal taking into account\nthe presence of an initial luminous phase of neutrino emission. This suggests\nhowever that some of the early events are due to supernova neutrinos and not to\nbackground. In summary, we formulate the hypothesis that some of the observed\nlow energy events are due to background and that some among them belong to a\npeculiar phase of emission, that could be further characterized by low energy\nneutrinos. Such an interpretation diminishes to a minimum the postulated number\nof background events and thus improves the agreement between the a priori and\nthe a posteriori expectations on the number of background events. We argue on\nthese grounds that there is no significant disagreement between the average\nenergy of the supernova neutrinos seen in Kamiokande-II and the conventional\nexpectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2006 17:24:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Nov 2006 15:26:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 May 2007 17:16:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-10-27"}

We show that, when the provers are allowed\nto coordinate their behavior using a shared entangled quantum state, a perfect\nparallel repetition theorem holds in the following sense. The prover's optimal\nsuccess probability for simultaneously playing a collection of XOR proof\nsystems is exactly the product of the individual optimal success probabilities.\nThis property is remarkable in view of the fact that, in the classical case\n(where the provers can only utilize classical information), it does not hold.\nThe theorem is proved by analyzing parities of XOR proof systems using\nsemidefinite programming techniques, which we then relate to parallel\nrepetitions of XOR games via Fourier analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Aug 2006 23:01:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Apr 2008 16:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-04-11"}

We may view the one-qubit\nstate-space H_1 as a standard representation of U(2) and the n-qubit state\nspace H_n=(H_1)^{(x) n} as the n-fold tensor product of standard\nrepresentations. Representation theory then decomposes H_n into irreducible\nsubrepresentations of K parametrized by combinatorial objects known as Young\ndiagrams. We argue that n-1 classically controlled measurement circuits, each a\nFredkin-gate interferometer, may be used to form a projection operator onto a\nrandom Young diagram irrep within H_n. For H_2, the two irreps happen to be\northogonal and correspond to the symmetric and wedge product. The latter is\nspanned by ket{Psi^-}, and the standard two-qubit swap interferometer requiring\na single Fredkin gate suffices in this case. In the n-qubit case, it is\npossible to extract many copies of ket{Psi^-}. Thus applying this process using\nnondestructive Fredkin interferometers allows for the creation of entangled\nbits (e-bits) using fully mixed states and von Neumann measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Aug 2006 00:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
