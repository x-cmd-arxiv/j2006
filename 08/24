Methods: We used the NACO\nadaptive optics system of the VLT in the J, H, and Ks bands to search for\ncompanions to Alpha Cen B.

One possibility is to use the projector-operator techniques,\nwhich pick up a set of trial atomic orbitals and project them onto the given\nHilbert space. Another possibility is to employ the downfolding method, which\neliminates the high-energy part of the spectrum and incorporates all related to\nit properties into the energy-dependence of an effective Hamiltonian. We show\nthat by modifying the high-energy part of the spectrum of the original\nHamiltonian $\\hat{H}$, which is rather irrelevant to the construction of WFs in\nthe low-energy part of the spectrum, these two methods can be formulated in an\nabsolutely exact and identical form, so that the main difference between them\nis reduced to the choice of the trial orbitals. Concerning the latter part of\nthe problem, we argue that an optimal choice for trial orbitals can be based on\nthe maximization of the site-diagonal part of the density matrix. The main idea\nis illustrated for a simple toy model, consisting of only two bands, as well as\nfor a more realistic example of $t_{2g}$ bands in V$_2$O$_3$.

This is observed in the B phase of superfluid 3He where the\ndynamics of quantized vortices changes radically in character as a function of\ntemperature. An abrupt transition to turbulence is the most peculiar\nconsequence. As distinct from viscous hydrodynamics, this transition to\nturbulence is not governed by the velocity-dependent Reynolds number, but by a\nvelocity-independent dimensionless parameter 1/q which depends only on the\ntemperature-dependent mutual friction -- the dissipation which sets in when\nvortices move with respect to the normal excitations of the liquid.

A new measuring technique was employed to identify this\nhydrodynamic transition: the injection of a tight bundle of many small vortex\nloops in applied vortex-free flow at relatively high velocities. These vortices\nare ejected from a vortex sheet covering the AB interface when a two-phase\nsample of 3He-A and 3He-B is set in rotation and the interface becomes unstable\nat a critical rotation velocity, triggered by the superfluid Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Aug 2006 13:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

It is based on the idea that hard and soft interactions proceed over\nwidely different time- and distance scales and are thus approximately\nindependent. The high-mass system is produced in a hard scattering process with\nexchange of two gluons between the protons. Its amplitude is calculable in\nterms of the gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) in the protons,\nwhich can be measured in J/psi production in exclusive ep scattering. The hard\nscattering process is modified by soft spectator interactions, which we\ncalculate in a model-independent way in terms of the pp elastic scattering\namplitude. Contributions from inelastic intermediate states are suppressed. A\nsimple geometric picture of the interplay of hard and soft interactions in\ndiffraction is obtained. The onset of the black-disk limit in pp scattering at\nTeV energies strongly suppresses diffraction at small impact parameters and is\nthe main factor in determining the RGS probability. Correlations between hard\nand soft interactions (e.g. due to scattering from the long-range pion field of\nthe proton, or due to possible short-range transverse correlations between\npartons) further decrease the RGS probability. We also investigate the\ndependence of the diffractive cross section on the transverse momenta of the\nfinal-state protons (\"diffraction pattern\").

In this paper we\ninvestigate the concept of certainty in quantum mechanics. Particularly, we\nshow how the probability-1 predictions derived from pure quantum states\nhighlight a fundamental difference between our Bayesian approach, on the one\nhand, and Copenhagen and similar interpretations on the other. We first review\nthe main arguments for the general claim that probabilities always represent\ndegrees of belief. We then argue that a quantum state prepared by some physical\ndevice always depends on an agent's prior beliefs, implying that the\nprobability-1 predictions derived from that state also depend on the agent's\nprior beliefs. Quantum certainty is therefore always some agent's certainty.\nConversely, if facts about an experimental setup could imply agent-independent\ncertainty for a measurement outcome, as in many Copenhagen-like\ninterpretations, that outcome would effectively correspond to a preexisting\nsystem property. The idea that measurement outcomes occurring with certainty\ncorrespond to preexisting system properties is, however, in conflict with\nlocality.
