We use\nHI Parkes All Sky Survey's (HIPASS) HI detected galaxies and infrared and radio\nfluxes to investigate star formation rates and efficiencies with respect to\nlocal surface density. For nearby (vel<10000 km\\s) HI galaxies we find a strong\ncorrelation between HI mass and star formation rate. The number of HI galaxies\ndecreases with increasing local surface density. For HI galaxies (1000<vel<6000\nkm\\s) there is no significant change in the star formation rate or the\nefficiency of star formation with respect to local surface density. We conclude\nthe SFR-density relation is due to a decrease in the number of HI star forming\ngalaxies in regions of high galaxy density and not to the suppression of star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2006 05:41:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We\nmainly derive the parameter dependences of physical properties of intracluster\nGCs (ICGCs) based on the results of 14 models. Our principle results are\nsummarized as follows. (1) The projected radial density profiles (Sigma_GC) of\nICGCs in clusters with different M_CL can be diverse, though ICGCs have\ninhomogeneous, asymmetric, and somewhat elongated distributions in most models.\nIf Sigma_GC (R) ~ R^alpha, alpha ranges from -1.5 to -2.5 for GCs in clusters.\n(2) Although total number of GCs within the central 0.05 Mpc (N_GC,0.05) and\n0.2 Mpc (N_GC,0.2) are diverse in different clusters, they can depend weakly on\nM_CL in such a way that both N_GC,0.05 and N_GC,0.2 are likely to be larger for\nclusters with larger M_CL. (3) Total number of GCs per cluster masses (specific\nfrequency of GCs for clusters of galaxies) are more likely to be larger in more\nmassive clusters, mainly because a larger number of earlier virialized objects\ncan be located in more massive clusters. (4) Spatial distributions of old GCs\nin clusters can depend on the truncation epoch of GC formation (z_trun) such\nthat they can be steeper and more compact in the models with higher z_trun. (5)\nThe mean metallicity of ICGCs in a cluster can be smaller than that of GCs\nwithin the cluster member galaxy-scale halos by ~ 0.3 in [Fe/H]. Metallicity\ndistribution functions (MDFs) of ICGCs show peak values around [Fe/H] ~ -1.6\nand do not have remarkable bimodality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2006 06:46:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We start out by\nperforming a conventional electronic-structure calculation including spin-orbit\ncoupling on a uniform and relatively coarse k-point mesh. From the resulting\nBloch states, maximally-localized Wannier functions are constructed which\nreproduce the ab-initio states up to the Fermi level. The Hamiltonian and\nposition-operator matrix elements, needed to represent the energy bands and\nBerry curvatures, are then set up between the Wannier orbitals. This completes\nthe first stage of the calculation, whereby the low-energy ab-initio problem is\ntransformed into an effective tight-binding form. The second stage only\ninvolves Fourier transforms and unitary transformations of the small matrices\nset up in the first stage. With these inexpensive operations, the quantities of\ninterest are interpolated onto a dense k-point mesh and used to evaluate the\nanomalous Hall conductivity as a Brillouin zone integral. The present scheme,\nwhich also avoids the cumbersome summation over all unoccupied states in the\nKubo formula, is applied to bcc Fe, giving excellent agreement with\nconventional, less efficient first-principles calculations.

The\ntwo-dimensional electron gas formed at the AlN/GaN heterointerface was\ncharacterized by Shubnikov-de Haas and Hall measurements. Using optical\nillumination, we were able to increase the carrier density of the\nAl0.15Ga0.85N/AlN/GaN sample from 1.6x10^{12} cm^{-2} to 5.9x1012 cm^{-2},\nwhile the electron mobility was enhanced from 9540 cm2/Vs to 21400 cm2/Vs at T\n= 1.6 K. The persistent photocurrent in both samples exhibited a strong\ndependence on illumination wavelength, being highest close to the bandgap and\ndecreasing at longer wavelengths. The PPC effect became fairly weak for\nillumination wavelengths longer than 530 nm and showed a more complex response\nwith an initial negative photoconductivity in the infrared region of the\nspectrum (>700 nm). The maximum PPC-efficiency for 390 nm illumination was\n0.011% and 0.005% for Al0.25Ga0.75N/AlN/GaN and Al0.15Ga0.85N/AlN/GaN samples,\nrespectively. After illumination, the carrier density could be reduced by\nannealing the sample. Annealing characteristics of the PPC effect were studied\nin the 20-280 K temperature range. We found that annealing at 280 K was not\nsufficient for full recovery of the carrier density. In fact, the PPC effect\noccurs in these samples even at room temperature. Comparing the measurement\nresults of two samples, the Al0.25Ga0.75N/AlN/GaN sample had a larger response\nto illumination and displayed a smaller recovery with thermal annealing. This\nresult suggests that the energy scales of the defect configuration-coordinate\ndiagrams for these samples are different, depending on their Al-composition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2006 15:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We\nexamine the important role of the interference between the signal and\nbackground contributions to the gamma+D -> \\Lambda+n+K+ amplitude in the\nextraction of the Theta+ signal from the gamma+D -> \\Lambda+n+K+ cross section.\nWe demonstrate that as a result of the cancellation between the interference\nand signal contributions, the Theta+ signal almost completely washes out after\nthe integration over p_n. This is consistent with the CLAS conclusion that no\nstatistically significant structures in the analysis of the gamma+D ->\n\\Lambda+n+K+ reaction were observed. Therefore, there is no disagreement\nbetween the theory and the experiment and the CLAS result does not refute the\nexistence of the Theta+.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2006 10:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The position variance of\nthe soliton shows a stronger than linear time-dependence (superdiffusion) as\nfound earlier for lattice solitons on FPU chains with nearest neighbour\ninteractions (NNI). In contrast to the NNI case where the position variance at\nmoderate soliton velocities has a considerable linear time-dependence (normal\ndiffusion), the solitons with LRI are dominated by a superdiffusive mechanism\nwhere the position variance mainly depends quadratic and cubic on time. Since\nthe superdiffusion seems to be generic for nontopological solitons, we want to\nilluminate the role of the soliton shape on the superdiffusive mechanism.\nTherefore, we concentrate on a FPU-like lattice with a certain class of\npower-law long-range interactions where the solitons have algebraic tails\ninstead of exponential tails in the case of FPU-type interactions (with or\nwithout Kac-Baker LRI). A collective variable (CV) approach in the continuum\napproximation of the system leads to stochastic integro-differential equations\nwhich can be reduced to Langevin-type equations for the CV position and width.\nWe are able to derive an analytical result for the soliton diffusion which\nagrees well with the simulations of the discrete system.

We consider a general quantum memory system\nconsisting of a medium of two level absorbers, with the qubit to be stored\nencoded in a single photon. We derive an analytic expression for our figure of\nmerit taking into account Gaussian fluctuations in the Hamiltonian parameters,\nwhich for example model inhomogeneous broadening and storage time dephasing.\nFinally we specialize to the case of an atomic quantum memory where\nfluctuations arise predominantly from Doppler broadening and motional\ndephasing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2006 11:20:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Oct 2006 09:15:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Jan 2007 09:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The nonlinear\nSchroedinger equation is mapped to the second Painleve equation, which is one\nof the best-known differential equations with a cubic nonlinearity. A\nquantization condition is derived from the connection formulae of these\nfunctions. Comparison with numerically exact results for a harmonic trap\ndemonstrates the benefit of the mapping method. Finally we discuss the\ninfluence of a shallow periodic potential on bright soliton solutions by a\nmapping to a constant potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Aug 2006 11:58:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-08-12"}
