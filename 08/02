Despite\nthe extensive studies at high-energy wavelengths, there is little or no\npublished work on its single-pulse behaviour in the radio band. In this report\nwe rectify this omission. We have found that the shape of the pulse profile of\nPSR B0656+14 requires an unusually long timescale to achieve stability (over\n25,000 pulses at 327 MHz). This instability is caused by very bright and narrow\npulses with widths and luminosities comparable to those observed for the RRATs.\nMany pulses are bright enough to qualify as \"giant pulses\", but are broader\nthan those usually meant by this term. At 327 MHz the brightest pulse was about\n116 times brighter than the average pulse. Although the most powerful pulses\npeak near the centre of the profile, occasional sudden strong pulses are also\nfound on the extreme leading edge of the profile. One of them has a peak flux\nof about 2000 times the average flux at that pulse longitude. No \"break\" in the\npulse-energy distributions is observed, but nevertheless there is evidence of\ntwo separate populations of pulses: bright pulses have a narrow \"spiky\"\nappearance consisting of short quasi-periodic bursts of emission with\nmicrostructure, in contrast to the underlying weaker broad pulses. Furthermore,\nthe spiky pulses tend to appear in clusters which arise and dissipate over\nabout 10 periods. We demonstrate that the spiky emission builds a narrow and\npeaked profile, whereas the weak emission produces a broad hump, which is\nlargely responsible for the shoulders in the total emission profiles at both\nhigh and low frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Aug 2006 16:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The comparison to the AHISS showed\nthat although optical surveys detect more galaxies per deg^2 than HI surveys,\ntheir drawback is the need for spectroscopic follow up observations to derive\ndistances. Blind HI surveys have no diameter limits, but tend to miss gas-poor\ngalaxies and all galaxies which lie outside their redshift limits. HI and\noptical surveys thus provide complementary information and sample different\nparts of the LSB galaxy population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2006 11:32:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The\ndimensional crossover is observed by studying the diamagnetic vortex\nfluctuations of the lowest-Landau-level type which occur in isochamps\nmagnetization curves, $MvsT$, for temperatures close to the transition\ntemperature $T_{c}(H)$. The study was accomplished by obtaining isochamps\nmagnetization curves as a function of temperature for fields in the range of\n0.4 T to 5 T. Magnetization curves for each sample when plotted together show\ntwo distinct well resolved crossing points, one formed by low field curves and\nlocated at a higher temperature than the other formed by high field curves. A\nlowest-Landau-level scaling analysis is applied to the curves forming the\ncrossing points and it is verified that lower field curves obey the\nthree-dimensional form of this scaling while the higher field curves obey the\ntwo-dimensional form. The results allow to observe the evolution of the\ndimensional crossover field $H_{cross}$, 3D-2D, with the content of oxygen in\n$YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-x}$.

About the only disadvantage of this model is that the stable\nequivalences cannot be defined by inverting those morphisms which induce\nisomorphisms on homotopy groups, because this would leave too many homotopy\ntypes. In this sense the naively defined homotopy groups are often `wrong`, and\nthen their precise relationship to the `true` homotopy groups (i.e., morphisms\nin the stable homotopy category from sphere spectra) appears mysterious.\n  In this paper I discuss and exploit extra algebraic structure on the naively\ndefined homotopy groups of symmetric spectra, namely a special kind of action\nof the monoid of injective self maps of the natural numbers. This extra\nstructure clarifies several issues about homotopy groups and stable\nequivalences and explains why the naive homotopy groups are not so wrong after\nall.

There are a few\npossible scenarios of spin ordered phase transitions: (a) nuclear matter with\nSLy4 interaction undergoes at some critical density a phase transition to a\nspin polarized state with the oppositely directed spins of neutrons and\nprotons; (b) in nuclear matter with SkI5 interaction a spin polarized state\nwith the like-directed neutron and proton spins is formed; (c) nuclear matter\nwith SkI3 interaction under increasing density, at first, undergoes a phase\ntransition to the state with the opposite directions of neutron and proton\nspins, which goes over at larger density to the state with the same direction\nof nucleon spins. Spin polarized states at strong excess neutrons over protons\nare accompanied by the long tails in the density profiles of the neutron spin\npolarization parameter near the critical density, if the energy gain of the\ntransition from the nonpolarized state to the polarized one is the decreasing\nfunction of isospin asymmetry (SLy4 force). In the opposite case, if the energy\ngain is increased with isospin asymmetry, there are no long tails in the\ndensity distribution of the neutron spin polarization parameter (SkI3, SkI5\nforces).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2006 08:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Oct 2006 19:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Sasaki defined the quantumness of a set of quantum states\nin \\cite{Quantumness}, which is closely related to the fidelity loss in\ntransmission of the quantum states through a classical channel. In\n\\cite{Fuchs}, Fuchs showed that in $d$-dimensional Hilbert space, minimum\nquantumness is $\\frac{2}{d+1}$, and this can be achieved by all rays in the\nspace. He left an open problem, asking whether fewer than $d^2$ states can\nachieve this bound. Recently, in a different context, A. J. Scott introduced a\nconcept of generalized $t$-design in \\cite{GenSphet}, which is a natural\ngeneralization of spherical $t$-design. In this paper, we show that the lower\nbound on the quantumness can be achieved if and only if the states form a\ngeneralized 2-design. As a corollary, we show that this bound can be only\nachieved if the number of states are larger or equal to $d^2$, answering the\nopen problem. Furthermore, we also show that the minimal set of such ensemble\nis Symmetric Informationally Complete POVM(SIC-POVM). This leads to an\nequivalence relation between SIC-POVM and minimal set of ensemble achieving\nminimal quantumness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2006 15:13:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Oct 2006 21:57:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Dec 2006 03:28:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 25 Mar 2007 15:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-19"}
