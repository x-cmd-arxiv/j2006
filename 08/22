At radio wavelengths\nA2255 is characterized by the presence of a polarized radio halo at the cluster\ncenter, a relic source at the cluster periphery, and several embedded radio\ngalaxies. The polarized radio emission from all these sources is modified by\nFaraday rotation as it traverses the magnetized intra-cluster medium. The\ndistribution of Faraday rotation can be used to probe the magnetic field\nstrength and topology in the cluster. For this purpose, we performed Very Large\nArray observations at 3.6 and 6 cm of four polarized radio galaxies embedded in\nA2255, obtaining detailed rotation measure images for three of them. We\nanalyzed these data together with the very deep radio halo image recently\nobtained by us. We simulated random 3-dimensional magnetic field models\ncharacterized by different power spectra and produced synthetic rotation\nmeasure and radio halo images. By comparing the simulations with the data we\nare able to determine the strength and the power spectrum of the intra-cluster\nmagnetic field fluctuations which best reproduce the observations. The data\nrequire a steepening of the power spectrum spectral index from n=2, at the\ncluster center, up to n=4, at the cluster periphery and the presence of\nfilamentary structures on large scales.

Three separate groups have reached the same conclusion that this event\nforces the existence of a new previously-unsuspected class of GRBs. The problem\nwith this conclusion is that the redshift is not secure, as the measured galaxy\nemission lines simply give the redshift of the brightest galaxy near the\nline-of-sight to the GRB afterglow. Fortunately, eight different luminosity\nindicators are known which can give the luminosity (and hence redshift) of the\nGRB itself. In combination, these luminosity indicators have already proven to\ngive redshifts with average one-sigma errors of 26% as based on 69 GRBs with\nspectroscopic redshifts. For GRB060614, the luminosity indicators all uniformly\ngive a high luminosity for the burst which implies a high redshift. This can be\nseen by the spiky many-peaked light curve, the high E_{peak} value, the\nnear-zero spectral lag, and the timing of the jet break. Quantitatively, we\nderive a redshift of 1.97 (1.44<z<2.81 one-sigma) from the eight luminosity\nindicators. Additional information from the detection of the afterglow in all\nSwift UVOT bands further constrains the redshift to be <1.71, so the final\nrange of allowed redshift is 1.44<z<1.71, which readily explains why no\nsupernova was visible.

We find a strong\ndetection of the 625 Hz oscillation in a pair of successive rotation cycles\nbegining about 230 s after the start of the flare. In these cycles we also\ndetect the 1,840 Hz QPO. When the 625 Hz QPO is detected we also confirm the\nsimultaneous presence of 30 and 92 Hz QPOs. The centroid frequency of the 625\nHz QPO detected with RXTE is within 1 Hz of the 626 Hz oscillation recently\nfound in RHESSI data from this hyperflare by Watts & Strohmayer. We argue that\nthese new findings provide further evidence for a connection of these\noscillations with global oscillation modes of neutron stars, in particular, the\nhigh frequency signals may represent toroidal modes with at least one radial\nnode in the crust. We discuss their implications in the context of this model,\nin particular for the depth of neutron star crusts\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Aug 2006 14:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

We present 12CO(2-1) line\nobservations of this region, obtained at the IRAM 30-m telescope (Pico Veleta,\nSpain). Results. In the optical, Sh2-219 is spherically symmetric around its\nexciting star; furthermore it is surrounded along three quarters of its\nperiphery by a ring of atomic hydrogen. This spherical symmetry breaks down at\ninfrared and millimetre wavelengths. A molecular cloud of about 2000\\msol lies\nat the southwestern border of Sh2-219, in the HI gap. Two molecular\ncondensations, elongated along the ionization front, probably result from the\ninteraction between the expanding HII region and the molecular cloud. In this\nregion of interaction there lies a cluster containing many highly reddened\nstars, as well as a massive star exciting an ultracompact HII region. More\nsurprisingly, the brightest parts of the molecular cloud form a `chimney',\nperpendicular to the ionization front.

A luminous H-alpha emission-line star, lying at one end of the chimney\nnear the ionization front, may be responsible for this structure.

While the best classical algorithm for this\nproblem uses log_2 N queries to the list, a quantum computer can solve the\nproblem using a constant factor fewer queries. However, the precise value of\nthis constant is unknown. By characterizing a class of quantum query algorithms\nfor ordered search in terms of a semidefinite program, we find new quantum\nalgorithms for small instances of the ordered search problem. Extending these\nalgorithms to arbitrarily large instances using recursion, we show that there\nis an exact quantum ordered search algorithm using 4 log_{605} N \\approx 0.433\nlog_2 N queries, which improves upon the previously best known exact algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2006 21:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We show that this amounts to a migration of entanglement in\nHilbert space, rather than real space. For the case of spontaneous parametric\ndown conversion, the migration of entanglement in transverse coordinates takes\nplace from modulus to phase of the bi-photon state and back again. We propose\nan experiment to observe this migration in Hilbert space and to determine the\nfull entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Aug 2006 22:53:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Apr 2007 18:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Individual single qubit measurements are performed\nsimultaneously, hence complete detection of entanglement is performed in a\nsingle run experiment.
