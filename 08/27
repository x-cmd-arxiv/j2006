These\nbound states may affect the cosmological abundances of Li6 and Li7 by enhancing\nnuclear rates that would otherwise be strongly suppressed. We consider the\neffects of these enhanced rates on the final abundances produced in Big-Bang\nnucleosynthesis (BBN), including injections of both electromagnetic and\nhadronic energy during and after BBN. We calculate the dominant two- and\nthree-body decays of both neutralino and stau NSPs, and model the\nelectromagnetic and hadronic decay products using the PYTHIA event generator\nand a cascade equation. Generically, the introduction of bound states drives\nlight element abundances further from their observed values; however, for small\nregions of parameter space bound state effects can bring lithium abundances in\nparticular in better accord with observations. We show that in regions where\nthe stau is the NSP with a lifetime longer than 10^3-10^4 s, the abundances of\nLi6 and Li7 are far in excess of those allowed by observations. For shorter\nlifetimes of order 1000 s, we comment on the possibility in minimal\nsupersymmetric and supergravity models that stau decays could reduce the Li7\nabundance from standard BBN values while at the same time enhancing the Li6\nabundance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Aug 2006 20:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Given a (possibly large) family of candidate partitions, we\nbuild a piecewise constant estimator (histogram) on each of them and then use\nthe data to select one estimator in the family. Choosing the square of a\nHellinger-type distance as our loss function, we show that each estimator built\non a given partition satisfies an analogue of the classical squared bias plus\nvariance risk bound. Moreover, the selection procedure leads to a final\nestimator satisfying some oracle-type inequality, with, as usual, a possible\nloss corresponding to the complexity of the family of partitions we consider.\nWhen this complexity is not too high, the selected estimator has a risk\nbounded, up to a universal constant, by the smallest risk bound obtained for\nthe estimators in the family. For suitable choices of the family of partitions,\nwe deduce uniform risk bounds over various classes of intensities. Our approach\napplies to the estimation of the intensity of an inhomogenous Poisson process,\namong other counting processes, or the estimation of the mean of a random\nvector with nonnegative components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Aug 2006 09:03:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-06-13"}
