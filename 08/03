As intermittency violates\nself-similarity of motions, it gets impossible to naively extrapolate the\nproperties of fluid obtained computationally with relatively low resolution to\nthe actual astrophysical situations. In terms of Astrophysics, intermittency\naffects turbulent heating, momentum transfer, interaction with cosmic rays,\nradio waves and many more essential processes. Because of its significance,\nstudies of intermittency call for coordinated efforts from both theorists and\nobservers. In terms of theoretical understanding we are still just scratching a\nsurface of a very rich subject. We have some theoretically well justified\nmodels that are poorly supported by experiments, we also have She-Leveque\nmodel, which could be vulnerable on theoretical grounds, but, nevertheless, is\nwell supported by experimental and laboratory data. I briefly discuss a rather\nmysterious property of turbulence called ``extended self-similarity'' and the\npossibilities that it opens for the intermittency research. Then I analyze\nsimulations of MHD intermittency performed by different groups and show that\ntheir results do not contradict to each other. Finally, I discuss the\nintermittency of density, intermittency of turbulence in the\nviscosity-dominated regime as well as the intermittency of polarization of\nAlfvenic modes. The latter provides an attractive solution to account for a\nslower cascading rate that is observed in some of the numerical experiments. I\nconclude by claiming that a substantial progress in the field may be achieved\nby studies of the turbulence intermittency via observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2006 17:12:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-10"}

To address this\nquestion, we calculate the orbits of model clusters in the time-variable\ngravitational potential of a Milky Way-sized galaxy, using the outputs of a\ncosmological N-body simulation. We find that at present the orbits are\nisotropic in the inner 50 kpc of the Galaxy and preferentially radial at larger\ndistances.

The\ncombination of two-body relaxation, tidal shocks, and stellar evolution drives\nthe evolution of the cluster mass function from an initial power law to a\npeaked distribution, in agreement with observations. However, not all initial\nconditions and not all evolution scenarios are consistent with the observed\nmass function of the Galactic globular clusters. The successful models require\nthe average cluster density to be constant initially for clusters of all mass\nand to remain constant with time.

However, only very\nfew WN stars have been re-analyzed by means of line-blanketed models yet.\n  AIMS: The quantitative spectral analysis of a large sample of Galactic WN\nstars with the most advanced generation of model atmospheres should provide an\nempirical basis for various studies about the origin, evolution, and physics of\nthe Wolf-Rayet stars and their powerful winds.\n  METHODS: We analyze a large sample of Galactic WN stars by means of the\nPotsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmospheres, which account for iron line\nblanketing and clumping. The results are compared with a synthetic population,\ngenerated from the Geneva tracks for massive star evolution. RESULTS: We obtain\na homogeneous set of stellar and atmospheric parameters for the Galactic WN\nstars, partly revising earlier results.\n  CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the results of our spectral analyses of the Galactic\nWN stars with the predictions of the Geneva evolutionary calculations, we\nconclude that there is rough qualitative agreement.

It is considered that electrons are\ninjected into the mechanism in test-particle regime directly from the high\nenergy tail of the downstream Maxwellian distribution function. The model can\nbe applied to most of the observed SNRs. It is shown that the model\nsuccessfully explains the many averaged observational properties of evolved\nshell-type SNRs. In particular, the radio surface brightness ($\\Sigma$) evolves\nwith diameter as $\\sim D^{-(0.3 \\div 0.5)}$, while the bounding shock is strong\n(Mach number is ${\\mathcal M} \\geq10$), followed by steep decrease (steeper\nthan $\\sim D^{-4.5}$) for ${\\cal M} <10$.

It is not\nexpected to be an exact theory of nature, but it should provide a good\napproximate description when the quantum effects of gravity itself do not play\na dominant role. A major impetus to the theory was provided by Hawking's\ncalculation of particle creation by black holes, showing that black holes\nradiate as perfect black bodies. During the past 30 years, considerable\nprogress has been made in giving a mathematically rigorous formulation of\nquantum field theory in curved spacetime. Major issues of principle with regard\nto the formulation of the theory arise from the lack of Poincare symmetry and\nthe absence of a preferred vacuum state or preferred notion of ``particles''.\nBy the mid-1980's, it was understood how all of these difficulties could be\novercome for free (i.e., non-self-interacting) quantum fields by formulating\nthe theory via the algebraic approach and focusing attention on the local field\nobservables rather than a notion of ``particles''. However, these ideas, by\nthemselves, were not adequate for the formulation of interacting quantum field\ntheory, even at a perturbative level, since standard renormalization\nprescriptions in Minkowski spacetime rely heavily on Poincare invariance and\nthe existence of a Poincare invariant vacuum state. However, during the past\ndecade, great progress has been made, mainly due to the importation into the\ntheory of the methods of ``microlocal analysis''.

A practical implementation of BB84\nthus requires explicit and efficiently decodable constructions of such codes,\nwhich are not known. On the other hand, modern coding theory abounds with\nnon-dual-containing codes with excellent performance and efficient decoding\nalgorithms. We show that the dual-containing constraint can be lifted at a\nsmall price: instead of a key distribution protocol, an efficiently\nimplementable key expansion protocol is obtained, capable of increasing the\nsize of a pre-shared key by a constant factor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Aug 2006 21:06:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 2007 21:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
