The WR binary fraction is high\n(>62%), on the basis of dust emission from WC stars, in addition to a\nsignificant WN binary fraction from hard X-ray detections according to Clark et\nal. We exploit the large WN population of Westerlund 1 to reassess its distance\n(~5.0kpc) and extinction (A_Ks ~ 0.96 mag), such that it is located at the edge\nof the Galactic bar, [..]. The observed ratio of WR stars to red and yellow\nhypergiants, N(WR)/N(RSG+YHG)~3, favours an age of 4.5-5.0 Myr, with individual\nWR stars descended from progenitors of initial mass ~ 40-55 Msun. Qualitative\nestimates of current masses for non-dusty, H-free WR stars are presented,\nrevealing 10-18 Msun, such that ~75% of the initial stellar mass has been\nremoved via stellar winds or close binary evolution. We present a revision to\nthe cluster turn-off mass for other Milky Way clusters in which WR stars are\nknown, based upon the latest temperature calibration for OB stars. Finally,\ncomparisons between the observed WR population and subtype distribution in\nWesterlund 1 and instantaneous burst evolutionary synthesis models are\npresented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2006 08:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

GF9-2 stands unique in the sense\nthat it shows H2O maser emission, a clear signpost of protostar formation,\nwhereas it does not have a high-velocity large-scale molecular outflow\nevidenced by our deep search for CO wing emission. These facts indicate that\nGF9-2 core is early enough after star formation so that it still retains some\ninformation of initial conditions for collapse. Our 350 um dust continuum\nemission image revealed the presence of a protostellar envelope in the center\nof a molecular core. The mass of the envelope is ~0.6 Msun from the 350 um flux\ndensity, while LTE mass of the core is ~3 Msun from moleuclar line\nobservations. Combining visibility data from the OVRO mm-array and the 45m\ntelescope, we found that the core has a radial density profile of\n$\\rho(r)\\propto r^{-2}$ for 0.003 < r/pc < 0.08 region. Molecular line data\nanalysis revealed that the velocity width of the core gas increases\ninward,while the outermost region maintains a velocity dispersion of a few\ntimes of the ambient sound speed. The broadened velocity width can be\ninterpreted as infall. Thus, the collapse in GF9-2 is likely to be described by\nan extension of the Larson-Penston solution for the period after formation of a\ncentral star. We derived the current mass accretion rate of ~3E-05 Msun/year\nfrom infall velocity of ~ 0.3 km/s at r~ 7000 AU.

Spectra taken in the same phases with different\ncompositions show interesting monotonic changes as the dopant concentration\nincreases, regardless of the dopant species. With increased Cr-doping, the AFI\nphase gap decreases and the PI phase gap increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2006 03:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

To this end, existing real-time\ndata dissemination work have developed packet scheduling schemes that\nprioritize packets according to their deadlines. In this paper, we first\ndemonstrate that not only the scheduling discipline but also the routing\nprotocol has a significant impact on the success of real-time sensor data\ndissemination. We show that the shortest path routing using the minimum number\nof hops leads to considerably better performance than Geographical Forwarding,\nwhich has often been used in existing real-time data dissemination work. We\nalso observe that packet prioritization by itself is not enough for real-time\ndata dissemination, since many high priority packets may simultaneously contend\nfor network resources, deteriorating the network performance. Instead,\nreal-time packets could be judiciously delayed to avoid severe contention as\nlong as their deadlines can be met. Based on this observation, we propose a\nJust-in-Time Scheduling (JiTS) algorithm for scheduling data transmissions to\nalleviate the shortcomings of the existing solutions. We explore several\npolicies for non-uniformly delaying data at different intermediate nodes to\naccount for the higher expected contention as the packet gets closer to the\nsink(s).

The colocation nature of the users allows cooperation, which\nincreases the overall achievable rate, from the transmitter to the destined\nuser. The transmitter is ignorant of the fading coefficients, while receivers\nhave access to perfect channel state information (CSI). This gives rise to the\nmulti-layer broadcast approach used by the transmitter. The broadcast approach\nallows, in our network setting, to improve the cooperation between the\ncolocated users. That is due to the nature of broadcasting, where the better\nthe channel quality, the more layers that can be decoded. The cooperation\nbetween the users is performed over an additive white Gaussian channels (AWGN),\nwith a relaying power constraint, and unlimited bandwidth. Three commonly used\ncooperation techniques are studied: amplify-forward (AF), compress-forward\n(CF), and decode-forward (DF). These methods are extended using the broadcast\napproach, for the case of relaxed decoding delay constraint. For this case a\nseparated processing of the layers, which includes multi-session cooperation is\nshown to be beneficial. Further, closed form expressions for infinitely many AF\nsessions and recursive expressions for the more complex CF are given. Numerical\nresults for the various cooperation strategies demonstrate the efficiency of\nmulti-session cooperation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2006 14:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

When this quantity is scalar it can be, for instance, the\ntemperature of the flow or the concentration of some pollutants. Because of the\ndiffusion term, one expects the equations to have a regularizing effect.\nHowever, in their Euler form, the equations describe the evolution of the\nquantity multiplied by the density of the flow. The parabolic structure is thus\ndegenerate near vacuum (when the density vanishes). In this paper we show that\nwe can nevertheless derive uniform $L^{p}$ bounds that do not depend on the\ndensity (in particular the bounds do not degenerate near vacuum). Furthermore\nthe result holds even when the density is only a measure. We investigate both\nthe scalar and the system case. In the former case, we obtain $L^{\\infty}$\nbounds. In the latter case the quantity being investigated could be the\nvelocity field in compressible Navier-Stokes type of equations, and we derive\nuniform $L^p$ bounds for some $p$ depending on the ratio between the two\nviscosity coefficients (the main additional difficulty in that case being to\ndeal with the second viscosity term involving the divergence of the velocity).\nSuch estimates are, to our knowledge, new and interesting since they are\nuniform with respect to the density. The proof relies mostly on a method\nintroduced by De Giorgi to obtain regularity results for elliptic equations\nwith discontinuous diffusion coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Aug 2006 23:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Whereas the classical geometrical optics approximation\npredicts an abrupt transition from complete transmission at small incidence\nangles to no transmission at large angles, the full model predicts a more\ngradual transition with partial reflection/transmission that is sensitive to\nthe canyon geometry and controlled by evanescent modes for small incidence\nangles and relatively short waves. Model results for large incidence angles are\ncompared with data from directional wave buoys deployed around the rim and over\nScripps Canyon, near San Diego, California, during the Nearshore Canyon\nExperiment (NCEX). Wave heights are observed to decay across the canyon by\nabout a factor 5 over a distance shorter than a wavelength. Yet, a spectral\nrefraction model predicts an even larger reduction by about a factor 10,\nbecause low frequency components cannot cross the canyon in the geometrical\noptics approximation. The coupled-mode model yields accurate results over and\nbehind the canyon. These results show that although most of the wave energy is\nrefractively trapped on the offshore rim of the canyon, a small fraction of the\nwave energy 'tunnels' across the canyon. Simplifications of the model that\nreduce it to the standard and modified mild slope equations also yield good\nresults, indicating that evanescent modes and high order bottom slope effects\nare of minor importance for the energy transformation of waves propagating\nacross depth contours at large oblique angles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2006 12:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

Structural studies show bare K+ ions occupying the\nnarrowest channel regions in a state of high coordination by all 8 surrounding\noxygen ligands from the channel walls. As in most channels, the driving force\nfor selectivity occurs when one ion is preferentially stabilized or\ndestabilized by the channel compared to water. In the common view of mechanism,\nmade vivid by textbook graphics, the driving force for selectivity in K-\nchannels arises by a fit, whereby the channel induces K+ ions to leave water by\noffering an environment like water for K+, in terms of both energy and local\nstructure. The implication that knowledge of local ion coordination in a liquid\nenvironment translates to design parameters in a protein ion channel, producing\nsimilar energetic stabilities, has gone unchallenged, presumably due in part to\nlack of consensus regarding ion coordination structures in liquid water.\nGrowing evidence that smaller numbers and different arrangements of ligands\ncoordinate K+ ions in liquid water, however, raises new questions regarding\nmechanism: how and why should ion coordination preferences change, and how does\nthat alter the current notions of ion selectivity? Our studies lead to a new\nchannelcentric paradigm for the mechanism of K+ ion channel selectivity.\nBecause the channel environment is not liquid-like, the channel necessarily\ninduces local structural changes in ion coordination preferences that enable\nstructural and energetic differentiation between ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2006 12:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
