The net output speed is a combination of the two input\nspeeds and is governed by the transmission ratio of the planetary gear train.\nThis new approach eliminates the use of a torque converter which is otherwise\nan indispensable part of all available automatic transmissions, thereby\nreducing the power loss that occurs in the box during the fluid coupling.

Confinement\narises through averaging of phase factors which are gauge-group center elements\nraised to the power of the Gauss linking numbers of vortices. The simplest\napproach to confinement counts this link number by counting the number of\nvortices, considered in d=3 as infinitely-long closed self-avoiding random\nwalks on a cubical lattice, piercing any surface spanning the Wilson loop. A\ngiven vortex, however, may pierce the spanning surface multiply with a link\nnumber smaller than the number of piercings. We call such vortices inert\n(although they may be only partially-inert). We estimate the dilution factor\nfrom inert vortices that reduces the ratio of fundamental string tension to\nvortex areal piercing density as roughly 0.6. Next we show how inert vortices\nresolve the old problem that the link number of a given vortex configuration is\nthe same for any choice of spanning surface, yet only one such surface appears\nin the Wilson loop expectation value. Third, we discuss semi- quantitatively a\nconfiguration of two distinct Wilson loops separated by a variable distance,\nand show how inert vortices govern the transition between two allowed forms of\nthe area law, one at small separation and one at large. The result is a\nfinite-range Van der Waals force between the loops. Finally, in a problem\nrelated to the double-loop problem, we argue that inert vortices do not affect\nthe fact that in the SU(3) baryonic area law, the mesonic string tension\nappears.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2006 23:08:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2006 18:12:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

They also showed how the Heine identity extends for such\nminors, which makes this question relevant to Random Matrix Theory.\nIndependently, Tracy and Widom (On the limit of some Toeplitz-like\ndeterminants, SIAM J.
