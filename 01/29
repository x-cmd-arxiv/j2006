Dividing the physical domain into\nfinite length overlapping elements empowers the approach to resolve fully\ncoupled dynamical interactions between neighbouring elements. The crucial\naspect of this approach is that the underlying theory organises the resolution\nof the vast multitude of subgrid microscale noise processes interacting via the\nnonlinear dynamics within and between neighbouring elements. Noise processes\nwith coarse structure across a finite element are the most significant noises\nfor the discrete model. Their influence also diffuses away to weakly correlate\nthe noise in the spatial discretisation. Nonlinear interactions have two\nfurther consequences: additive forcing generates multiplicative noise in the\ndiscretisation; and effectively new noise processes appear in the macroscale\ndiscretisation.

Therefore a single generalized\nmodels can describe a class of systems which share a similar structure. Despite\nthis generality, the proposed approach allows us to study the dynamical\nproperties of generalized models efficiently in the framework of local\nbifurcation theory. The approach is based on a normalization procedure that is\nused to identify natural parameters of the system. The Jacobian in a steady\nstate is then derived as a function of these parameters. The analytical\ncomputation of local bifurcations using computer algebra reveals conditions for\nthe local asymptotic stability of steady states and provides certain insights\non the global dynamics of the system. The proposed approach yields a close\nconnection between modelling and nonlinear dynamics. We illustrate the\ninvestigation of generalized models by considering examples from three\ndifferent disciplines of science: a socio-economic model of dynastic cycles in\nchina, a model for a coupled laser system and a general ecological food web.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2006 13:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The most prominent among these\nmeasures is the relative contact order (CO), which is the average CO or\n'localness' of all contacts in the native protein structure, divided by the\nchain length. Here, we test whether such measures can be generalized to capture\nthe effect of chain crosslinks on the folding rate. Crosslinks change the chain\nconnectivity and therefore also the localness of some of the the native\ncontacts. These changes in localness can be taken into account by the\ngraph-theoretical concept of effective contact order (ECO). The relative ECO,\nhowever, the natural extension of the relative CO for proteins with crosslinks,\noverestimates the changes in the folding rates caused by crosslinks. We suggest\nhere a novel measure of native-state topology, the relative logCO, and its\nnatural extension, the relative logECO. The relative logCO is the average value\nfor the logarithm of the CO of all contacts, divided by the logarithm of the\nchain length. The relative log(E)CO reproduces the folding rates of a set of 26\ntwo-state proteins without crosslinks with essentially the same high\ncorrelation coefficient as the relative CO. In addition, it also captures the\nfolding rates of 8 two-state proteins with crosslinks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2006 17:38:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
