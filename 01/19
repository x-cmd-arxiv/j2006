To estimate the electron\npressure along the line of sight and its contribution to the Sunyaev-Zeldovich\ncomponent of the CMB anisotropies, we assume the non-linear baryonic density\ncontrast is well described by a log-normal distribution. For model parameters\nin agreement with observations and for an experiment operating in the\nRayleigh-Jeans regime, the largest IGM contribution is expected at scales\ncorresponding to multipole numbers of about 2000. The amplitude is rather\nuncertain and could be as large as 100-200 [mikroK]^2, comparable to the\ncontribution of galaxy clusters. The actual value is strongly dependent on the\ngas polytropic index and the amplitude of the matter power spectrum sigma_8. At\nall redshifts, the largest contribution comes from scales very close to the\ncomoving baryon Jeans length. This scale is not yet resolved in numerical\nsimulations that follow the evolution of gas on cosmological scales. The\nanisotropy generated by the Intergalactic Medium could make compatible the\nexcess of power measured by Cosmic Background Imager (CBI) on scales of l >\n2000 with sigma_8=0.9. Taking the CBI result as an upper limit, the polytropic\nindex can be constrained to < 1.5 at 2-sigma level at redshifts z ~ 0.1-0.4.\nWith its large frequency coverage, the PLANCK satellite will be able to measure\nthe secondary anisotropies coming from hot gas.

In addition to allowing for the freeze out of `heavy'\nspecies on to grains, we have computed the variation of population densities of\nthe different nuclear spin states of ``tracer'' molecular ions such as H2D+ and\nD2H+. Processes which determine the relative populations of the nuclear spin\nstates of molecules and molecular ions have received much less attention in the\nliterature than those involved in their deuteration; but in fact the former\nprocesses are as significant as the latter and often involve the same\nreactants. We find that the ortho:para ratio of some species, e.g. H2D+, vary\nconsiderably as the density increases. Because the dynamical timescale is much\nshorter than some of the chemical timescales, there can be large departures of\nthe predictions of the free--fall model from the steady state solution at the\nsame density and temperature. In the case of H2, it seems unlikely that the\nsteady state value of the ortho:para ratio is attained before protostellar\ncollapse from the progenitor molecular cloud commences. Values of the\northo:para H2 ratio much higher than in steady state, which would prevail in\n``young'' molecular clouds, are found to be inconsistent with high levels of\ndeuteration of the gas. The internal energy of ortho--H2 acts as a reservoir of\nchemical energy which inhibits the deuteration of H3+ and hence of other\nspecies, such as N2H+ and NH3. In essence, the deuteration of molecular ions\nand molecules is sensitive to the ortho:para H2 ratio and hence to the chemical\nand thermal history of the parent molecular cloud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2006 13:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

For example, electrochemical underpotential deposition\nproceeds by this mechanism. One major difference from adsorption in vacuum\nsurface science is that under control of the electrode potential and in the\nabsence of mass-transport limitations, local adsorption equilibrium is\napproximately established. We analyze our results using the theory of\nKolmogorov, Johnson and Mehl, and Avrami (KJMA), which we extend to an\nexponentially decaying nucleation rate. Such a decay may occur due to a\nsuppression of nucleation around existing clusters in the presence of lateral\nadsorbate diffusion. Correlation functions prove the existence of such\nexclusion zones. By comparison with microscopic results for the nucleation rate\nI and the interface velocity of the growing clusters v, we can show that the\nKJMA theory yields the correct order of magnitude for Iv^2. This is true even\nthough the spatial correlations mediated by diffusion are neglected. The\ndecaying nucleation rate causes a gradual crossover from continuous to\ninstantaneous nucleation, which is complete when the decay of the nucleation\nrate is very fast on the time scale of the phase transformation. Hence,\ninstantaneous nucleation can be homogeneous, producing negative minima in the\ntwo-point correlation functions.
