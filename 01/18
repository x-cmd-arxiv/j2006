Below 8 GHz, the\npoint-like VLBI source is affected by scatter-broadening of the turbulent\ninterstellar medium, which is located along the line of sight and likely\nassociated with the Cygnus region. We present and discuss the measured\nfrequency dependence of the source size, which shows a power-law with slope of\n-1.91+/-0.05. From the measured scattering angle at 1GHz of 77.1+/-4.0mas a\nSM=0.43+/-0.04 m^{-20/3} kpc is derived, consistent with the general properties\nof the ISM in this direction. The decreasing effect of angular broadening\ntowards higher frequencies allows to study the internal structure of the\nsource. Above 8GHz new VLBI observations reveal a one-sided slightly\nsouth-bending core-jet structure, with stationary and apparent superluminally\nmoving jet components. The jet components move on non-ballistic trajectories.\nIn AGN, total flux density variations are often related to the emergence of new\nVLBI components. However, during almost eleven years no new component was\nejected in B2005+403. In the flux density variability a trough is observed at\n5-37 GHz between 1996 and 2001. This can be explained as a blending effect of\njet component fluxes. Dense in time sampled flux density monitoring\nobservations reveal intra-day variability at 1.6GHz impling a second, less\ndense or turbulent scattering screen at few to hundred parsec distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Jan 2006 16:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-09-26"}

Indeed, it does not even admit a group action with finitely many orbits\nand finite point stabilizers.\n  The l^2-spectrum of the ``simple random walk'' operator on DL is always pure\npoint. When d=2, it is known explicitly from previous work, while for d=3 we\ncompute it explicitly. Finally, we determine the Poisson boundary of a large\nclass of group-invariant random walks on DL.

The process of knowledge acquisition\ncan then be simulated by considering the number of nodes visited as a single\nagent moves along the network, starting from its lowest layer. It is shown that\nhierarchical networks, i.e. networks composed of successive interconnected\nlayers, arise naturally as a consequence of compositions of the prerequisite\nrelationships between the nodes. In order to avoid deadlocks, i.e. unreachable\nnodes, the subnetwork in each layer is assumed to be a connected component.\nSeveral configurations of such hierarchical knowledge networks are simulated\nand the performance of the moving agent quantified in terms of the percentage\nof visited nodes after each movement.

In these protocols, the secret\ntransmitting order of particles ensures the security of communication, and no\nsecret messages are leaked even if the communication is interrupted for\nsecurity. This strategy of security for communication is also generalized to\nquantum dialogue. It not only ensures the unconditional security but also\nimproves the efficiency of communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2006 09:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Here we\ndescribe a new design for a q-wire with perfect transmission using a uniformly\ncoupled Ising spin chain subject to global (homogeneously-applied) pulses.\nBesides allowing for perfect transport of single qubits, the design also yields\nthe perfect ``mirroring'' of multiply encoded qubits within the wire. We\nfurther utilise this global-pulse generated perfect mirror operation as a\n``clock cycle'' to perform universal quantum computation on these multiply\nencoded qubits. We demonstrate the operation of single and two-qubit quantum\nlogic gates and show that only $N-1$ complete mirror cycles are required to\nexecute a quantum Fourier transform on $N$ qubits encoded within the q-wire.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Jan 2006 14:44:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Apr 2006 07:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
