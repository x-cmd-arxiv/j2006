As a result, many of the tightly bound stars very near the MBH are\nrapidly destroyed by falling into the MBH on low-angular momentum orbits, while\nthe orbits of the remaining stars are efficiently randomized. We solve\nnumerically the Fokker-Planck equation in energy for the steady state\ndistribution of a single mass population with a RR sink term.

We\nargue that the producing mechanism is late internal shocks, which implies that\nthe central engine is still active at 210s, though with a reduced power with\nrespect to the prompt emission. The X-ray light curve flattens to a very\nshallow slope with decay index of ~0.5 after ~4400s, which also supports\ncontinued central engine activity at late times. This burst is classified as an\nX-ray flash, with a relatively low fluence (~10^-7 erg cm^-2 in the 15-350 keV\nband, E_iso~10^51 erg), a soft spectrum (photon index 2.65), no significant\nflux above ~50 keV and a peak energy E_p<15 keV. XRF 050406 is one of the first\nexamples of a well-studied X-ray light curve of an XRF. We show that the main\nafterglow characteristics are qualitatively similar to those of normal GRBs. In\nparticular, X-ray flares superimposed on a power-law light curve have now been\nseen in both XRFs and GRBs. This indicates that a similar mechanism may be at\nwork for both kinds of events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2006 13:58:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2006 12:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-19"}

The intuitive explanation provided by Beck for\nsuperstatistics is based on the ansatz that the system under consideration,\nduring its evolution, travels within its phase space which is partitioned into\ncells. Within each cell, the system is described by ordinary Maxwell-Boltzmann\nstatistical mechanics, i.e., its statistical distribution is the canonical one,\nbut b varies from cell to cell, with its own probability density f(b). In this\nwork we first address that the explicit inclusion of the density of states in\nthis description is essential for its correctness. The correction is not\nrelevant for developments of the theory, but points to the fact that its\ncorrect starting point, as well its meaning, must be found at a more basic\nlevel: the pure probability product rule involving the intensive variable b and\nits conjugate extensive one. The question therefore arises how to assign a\nmeaning to these probabilities for each specific problem. We will see that it\nis easily answered through Bayesian analysis.

This article provides\nsome theorems on the convergence criteria of a similar series expansion for\nthis more general case, which is not covered yet by the literature.\n  The main result is that a series expansion provides a robust unbiased\nunfolding and deconvolution method. For the case of the deconvolution, such a\nseries expansion can always be applied, and the method always recovers the\nmaximum possible information about the initial probability density function,\nthus the method is optimal in this sense. A very significant advantage of the\npresented method is that one does not have to introduce ad hoc frequency\nregulations etc., as in the case of usual naive deconvolution methods. For the\ncase of general unfolding problems, we present a computer-testable sufficient\ncondition for the convergence of the series expansion in question.\n  Some test examples and physics applications are also given. The most\nimportant physics example shall be (which originally motivated our survey on\nthis topic) the case of pi^0 --> gamma+gamma particle decay: we show that one\ncan recover the initial pi^0 momentum density function form the measured single\ngamma momentum density function by our series expansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2006 11:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Motivated by Crick's suggestion that sleep is the brain's\nway of ``taking out the trash,'' a suggestion that is supported by emerging\nevidence, we consider the problem of the filling and emptying of a tank. At any\ngiven time, the tank may take in external resource, or fill, if resource is\navailable at that time, or it may empty. The filling phases correspond to\ninformation input from the environment, or input of some material in general,\nwhile the emptying phases correspond to the processing of the resource. Given a\nresource-availablility profile over some time interval $ T $, we develop a\ncanonical algorithm for determining the fill-empty profile that produces the\nmaximum quantity of processed resource at the end of the time interval. From\nthis algorithm, it readily follows that for a periodically oscillating\nresource-availability profile, the optimal fill-empty strategy is given by a\nfill period when resource is available, followed by an empty period when\nresource is not. This cycling behavior is analogous to the wake-sleep cycles in\norganismal life, where the generally nocturnal sleep phase is a period where\nthe information collected from the day's activities may be processed. The sleep\ncycle is then a mechanism for the organism to process a maximal amount of\ninformation over a daily cycle.

The repulsive potential\narises naturally outside the conductor and is effective at distances from the\nconductor surface of about 400nm, intermediate between the van der Waals and\nthe Casimir-Polder regions of variation. We propose that such a field-free\nreflection capability should be useful as a component in cold atom traps. It\nshould be practically free of undesirable field fluctuations and would be\noperative at distances for which surface roughness, dissipative effects and\nother finite conductivity effects should be negligibly small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2006 10:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We revisit quantum\nteleportation from the perspective of the braid group, the symmetric group and\nthe virtual braid group, and propose the braid teleportation, the teleportation\nswapping and the virtual braid teleportation, respectively. Besides, we present\na physical interpretation for the braid teleportation and explain it as a sort\nof crossed measurement. On the other hand, we propose the extended\nTemperley--Lieb diagrammatical approach to various topics including quantum\nteleportation, entanglement swapping, universal quantum computation, quantum\ninformation flow, and etc. The extended Temperley--Lieb diagrammatical rules\nare devised to present a diagrammatical representation for the extended\nTemperley--Lieb category which is the collection of all the Temperley--Lieb\nalgebras with local unitary transformations. In this approach, various\ndescriptions of quantum teleportation are unified in a diagrammatical sense,\nuniversal quantum computation is performed with the help of topological-like\nfeatures, and quantum information flow is recast in a correct formulation. In\nother words, we propose the extended Temperley--Lieb category as a mathematical\nframework to describe quantum information and computation involving maximally\nentangled states and local unitary transformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Jan 2006 14:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jun 2006 08:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 Mar 2008 20:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-11"}
