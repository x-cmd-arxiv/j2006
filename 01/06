This illumination exerts a non-axisymmetric radiation pressure on the\nsurface of the disc resulting in a torque that acts on the disc to induce a\ntwist or warp. Initially planar discs are unstable to warping driven by the\nradiation torque and in general the warps also precess in a retrograde\ndirection relative to the orbital flow. We simulate a number of X-ray binary\nsystems which have different mass ratios using a number of different\nluminosities for each. Radiation-driven warping occurs for all systems\nsimulated. For mass ratios q ~ 0.1 a moderate warp occurs in the inner disc\nwhile the outer disc remains in the orbital plane (c.f. X 1916-053). For less\nextreme mass ratios the entire disc tilts out of the orbital plane (c.f. Her\nX-1). For discs that are tilted out of the orbital plane in which the outer\nedge material of the disc is precessing in a prograde direction we obtain both\npositive and negative superhumps simultaneously in the dissipation light curve\n(c.f. V603 Aql).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2006 15:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Males of the\nIchneumonidae Diadromus pulchellus, solitary endoparasitoid of A. assectella\npupae are normally haploid, but diploid males are present in a natural\npopulation and can be obtained in a experimental population. The future of an\novocyte laid by mated females of the solitary endoparasitoid Diadromus\npulchellus was characterised by 6 probabilities related to the sex and the\ndevelopment of the ovocyte. The probabilities of fertilisation of female\novocyte (k1) or non-fertilisation (k3) showed that an inseminated female\nfunctioned as a unmated female for half of the time (since k1= 0.492 and k3 =\n0.455) with the probability of fertilisation of male ovocyte (k2 = 0.053).The\nsurvival probabilities of each type of ovocyte showed that an ovocyte had a\nhigh probability of developing up to the adult stage, although the difference\nbetween the calculated sex ratios at laying (males / females = 1.032) and at\nemergence (0.90) revealed a slight reduction in the number of haploid sons. The\nprobabilities of fertilisation and of viability of all the ovocytes laid by\neach of the 33 mated females were analysed by an ascending hierarchical\nclassification of Euclidean distances and by an analysis of their principal\ncomponents. The 33 mothers were distributed into 4 distinct sub-groups\ncharacterised by a sex ratio varying from an exclusive presence of females to\nan exclusive presence of males. Our hypothesis was that this distribution in 4\nsub-sets could not simply result from the random nature of the sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2006 10:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-16"}
