The 11.7um flux has\nincreased significantly since our last observations on day 6067. The images\nclearly show that all the emission arises from the equatorial ring (ER).\nSpectra obtained with Spitzer, on day 6184 with MIPS at 24um, on day 6130 with\nIRAC in the 3.6-8um region, and on day 6190 with IRS in the 12-37um region show\nthat the emission consists of thermal emission from silicate dust that\ncondensed out in the red giant wind of the progenitor star. The dust\ntemperature is ~166K, and the emitting dust mass is ~2.6 x 10-6 Msun. Lines of\n[Ne II]12.82um and [Ne III]15.56um are clearly present, as well as a weak [Si\nII]34.8um line. We also detect two lines near 26um which we tentatively ascribe\nto [Fe II]25.99um and [O IV]25.91um. Comparison of the Gemini 11.7um image with\nX-ray images from Chandra, UV-optical images from HST, and radio synchrotron\nimages obtained by the ATCA show generally good correlation of the images\nacross all wavelengths. Because of the limited resolution of the mid-IR images\nwe cannot uniquely determine the location or heating mechanism of the dust\ngiving rise to the emission.

In either case\nthe dust-to-gas mass ratio in the circumstellar medium around the supernova is\nsignificantly lower than that in the general ISM of the LMC, suggesting either\na low condensation efficiency in the wind of the progenitor star, or the\nefficient destruction of the dust by the SN blast wave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2006 01:45:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2006 14:31:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Sep 2006 10:42:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

It also results in different Curie temperatures for the\nc-axis and the basal plane, highlighting a rare spin-orbit coupling with the\ncrystal field states. In contrast, Ca doping enhances the c-axis ferromagnetism\nand the magnetic anisotropy. La doping also induces a dimensional crossover in\nthe interlayer transport whereas Ca doping exhibits a tunneling\nmagnetoresistance and an extraordinary T3/2-dependence of the resisitivity. The\ndrastic changes caused by the dilute doping demonstrate a rare borderline\nmagnetism that is delicately linked to the interplay of the density of states\nand spin-orbit coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2006 18:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We find that the optimal\nstrategy depends critically on the viral transmission level (reproductive rate)\nof the virus: morbidity-based strategies outperform mortality-based strategies\nfor moderately transmissible strains, while the reverse is true for highly\ntransmissible strains.
