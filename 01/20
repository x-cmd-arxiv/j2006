Until\nnow this soft X-ray excess was attributed, either to reflection of the hard\nX-ray source by the accretion disk, or to the presence of an additional\ncomptonizing medium, giving a steep spectrum. An alternative solution proposed\nby Gierlinski and Done (2004) is that a single power law well represents both\nthe soft and the hard X-ray emission and the impression of the soft X-ray\nexcess is due to absorption of a primary power law by a relativistic wind. We\nexamine the advantages and drawbacks of reflection versus absorption models,\nand we conclude that the observed spectra can be well modeled, either by\nabsorption (for a strong excess), or by reflection (for a weak excess). However\nthe physical conditions required by the absorption models do not seem very\nrealistic: we would prefer an ''hybrid model''.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Jan 2006 23:14:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Electronic structure calculations based on first-principles\ndensity-functional theory with generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for\nmore than sixty double perovskites LaCa$BB'$O$_6$ have been performed using the\nall-electron full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave method.

Furthermore they exhibit thermodynamic\nanomalies in the density and compressibility, the nature of which may be akin\nto those occurring in water. Previous simulation studies of ramp potentials\nhave focused on just one functional form, for which the LLCP is\nthermodynamically stable. In this work we construct a series of ramp\npotentials, which interpolate between this previously studied form and a\nramp-based approximation to the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential. By means of Monte\nCarlo simulation, we locate the LLCP, the first order high density liquid\n(HDL)-low density liquid (LDL) coexistence line, and the line of density maxima\nfor a selection of potentials in the series. We observe that as the LJ limit is\napproached, the LLCP becomes metastable with respect to freezing into a\nhexagonal close packed crystalline solid. The qualitative nature of the phase\nbehaviour in this regime shows a remarkable resemblance to that seen in\nsimulation studies of accurate water models. Specifically, the density of the\nliquid phase exceeds that of the solid; the gradient of the metastable LDL-HDL\nline is negative in the pressure (p)-temperature (T) plane; while the line of\ndensity maxima in the p-T plane has a shape similar to that seen in water and\nextends well into the {\\em stable} liquid region of the phase diagram.

We show residue specific reduced discrete\nstate models can represent the backbone conformations of proteins with small\nRMSD values. However, no potential functions exist that are designed for such\nsimplified protein models. In this study, we develop optimal potential\nfunctions by combining contact interaction descriptors and local\nsequence-structure descriptors. The form of the potential function is a\nweighted linear sum of all descriptors, and the optimal weight coefficients are\nobtained through optimization using both native and decoy structures. The\nperformance of the potential function in test of discriminating native protein\nstructures from decoys is evaluated using several benchmark decoy sets.

By reducing the residue alphabets down to size 5 for local\nstructure-sequence relationship, the performance of the potential function can\nbe further improved.

If the observer\nconsistently realizes the outcome which maximizes the likelihood ratio that the\noutcome pertains to the system under study (and not to his own state), he will\nbe called Bayes-optimal. We calculate the probability if for each trial of the\nexperiment the observer is in a new state picked randomly from his set of\nstates, and the system under investigation is taken from an ensemble of\nidentical pure states. For classical statistical mixtures, the relative\nfrequency resulting from the maximum likelihood principle is an unbiased\nestimator of the components of the mixture.
