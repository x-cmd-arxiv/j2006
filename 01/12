The result is that both metrics agree in the\nbuffer zone, up to the errors in the approximations.

Several\nspecific chemical kinetic models have been developed to explain the intriguing\ntransitions from the \"catch-bonds\" to the \"slip-bonds\". In this work we suggest\nthat the counterintuitive forced dissociation of the complexes is a typical\nrate process with dynamic disorder. An uniform one-dimension force modulating\nAgmon-Hopfield model is used to quantitatively describe the transitions\nobserved in the single bond P-selctin glycoprotein ligand\n1(PSGL-1)$-$P-selectin forced dissociation experiments, which were respectively\ncarried out on the constant force [Marshall, {\\it et al.}, (2003) Nature {\\bf\n423}, 190-193] and the force steady- or jump-ramp [Evans {\\it et al.}, (2004)\nProc.
