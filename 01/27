The strongest\nargument against such large fields is that one might expect starbursts to have\nsteep radio spectra indicative of strong synchrotron cooling, which is not\nobserved.

We supplement\nour analysis with data from the Chandra Deep Field North (CDFN). The addition\nof this field allows better probe of the correlation function at small scales.\nA total of 233 and 252 sources with spectroscopic information are used in the\nstudy of the CLASXS and CDFN fields respectively. We calculate both\nredshift-space and projected correlation functions in comoving coordinates,\naveraged over the redshift range of 0.1<z<3.0, for both CLASXS and CDFN fields\nfor a standard cosmology with \\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.73, \\Omega_{M} = 0.27, and\nH_0 = 0.71. The correlation function for the CLASXS field over scales of 3 Mpc\n<s< 200 Mpc can be modeled as a power-law of the form \\xi(s) =\n(s/s_0)^{-\\gamma}, with \\gamma = 1.6^{+0.4}_{-0.3} and s_0 = 8.0^{+1.4}_{-1.5}\nMpc. The redshift-space correlation function for CDFN on scales of 1\nMpc$<s<$~100 Mpc is found to have a similar correlation length $s_0 =\n8.55^{+0.75}_{-0.74}$ Mpc, but a shallower slope ($\\gamma = 1.3 \\pm 0.1$). The\nreal-space correlation functions derived from the projected correlation\nfunctions, are found to be $r_0 = 8.1^{+1.2}_{-2.2}$ Mpc, and $\\gamma = 2.1 \\pm\n0.5$ for the CLASXS field, and $r_0 = 5.8^{+1.0}_{-1.5}$ Mpc, $\\gamma =\n1.38^{+0.12}_{-0.14}$ for the CDFN field. By comparing the real- and\nredshift-space correlation functions in the combined CLASXS and CDFN samples,\nwe are able to estimate the redshift distortion parameter $\\beta = 0.4 \\pm 0.2$\nat an effective redshift $z = 0.94$.(abridged)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2006 03:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Feb 2006 18:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Instead, a\nquantization of the electronic drift current in the presence of crossed\nelectric and magnetic fields is employed to construct a non-linear transport\ntheory. Another important ingredient of the alternative theory is the coupling\nof the two-dimensional electron gas to the leads and the applied voltages. By\nworking in a picture, where the external voltages fix the chemical potential in\nthe 2D subsystem, the experimentally observed linear relation between the\nvoltage and the location of the quantum Hall plateaus finds an natural\nexplanation. Also, the classical Hall effect emerges as a natural limit of the\nquantum Hall effect.\n  For low temperatures (or high currents), a non-integer substructure splits\nhigher Landau levels into sublevels. The appearence of substructure and\nnon-integer plateaus in the resistivity is NOT linked to electron-electron\ninteractions, but caused by the presence of a (linear) electric field. Some of\nthe resulting fractions correspond exactly to half-integer plateaus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2006 21:29:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2006 22:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In order to quantify LP decoding, and thus to describe\nperformance of the error-correction scheme at moderate and large\nSignal-to-Noise-Ratios (SNR), it is important to study the relaxed polytope to\nunderstand better its vertexes, so-called pseudo-codewords, especially those\nwhich are neighbors of the zero codeword. In this manuscript we propose a\ntechnique to heuristically create a list of these neighbors and their\ndistances. Our pseudo-codeword-search algorithm starts by randomly choosing the\ninitial configuration of the noise. The configuration is modified through a\ndiscrete number of steps. Each step consists of two sub-steps. Firstly, one\napplies an LP decoder to the noise-configuration deriving a pseudo-codeword.\nSecondly, one finds configuration of the noise equidistant from the pseudo\ncodeword and the zero codeword. The resulting noise configuration is used as an\nentry for the next step. The iterations converge rapidly to a pseudo-codeword\nneighboring the zero codeword. Repeated many times, this procedure is\ncharacterized by the distribution function (frequency spectrum) of the\npseudo-codeword effective distance. The effective distance of the coding scheme\nis approximated by the shortest distance pseudo-codeword in the spectrum.

To\ndate, WDSR patterns based on a deformation of special relativity with a\nprivileged (vacuum) rest frame are the only clear and consistent candidate to\nexplain a possible absence of the GZK cutoff invoking deviations from standard\nrelativity. It is also to be emphasized, as in hep-ph/0510361, that the usual\nhypothesis of a power-like dependence of the LSV effective parameters not being\naltered by any intermediate energy scale is not the only possible one.\nTherefore, experiments sensitive to UHCR energies as high as possible become\nnecessary irrespective of AUGER results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2006 20:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The position and the momentum operators (PM-operators) of the system\ndo not satisfy the canonical commutation relations (CCRs). Instead they obey\nthe weaker postulates for the oscillator to be a Wigner quantum system. In\nparticular the PM-operators fulfil the main postulate, which is due to Wigner:\nthey satisfy the equations of motion (the Hamiltonian's equations) and the\nHeisenberg equations. One of the relevant features is that the coordinate (the\nmomentum) operators do not commute, but instead their squares do commute. As a\nresult the space structure of the basis states corresponds to pictures when\neach oscillating particle is measured to occupy with equal probability only\nfinite number of points, typically the eight vertices of a parallelepiped. The\nstate spaces are finite-dimensional, the spectrum of the energy is finite with\nequally spaced energy levels. An essentially new feature is that the angular\nmomenta of all particles are aligned. Therefore there exists a strong\ninteraction or correlation between the particles, which is not of dynamical,\nbut of statistical origin. Another relevant feature is that the standard\ndeviations of, say, the $k$-th coordinate and the momenta of $\\alpha$-th is $\n\\Delta \\hat R_{\\alpha k} \\Delta \\hat P_{\\alpha k} \\le {p \\hbar/{|N-3|}}~(~N\\ne\n3,~ p -$fixed positive integer), namely instead of uncertainty relations one\nhas \"certainty\" relations. The underlying Lie superalgebraic structure of the\noscillator is also relevant and will be explained in the context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2006 11:45:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2006 16:03:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We apply combinatorial considerations to standard enzyme kinetics\nand in this way we extend to the dynamic regime a simplified version of the\ntraditional models on the allosteric regulation of protein functions. We link a\ngeneric modification chain to a downstream Michaelis-Menten enzymatic reaction\nand we demonstrate numerically that this accounts both for thresholds and long\ntime delays in the conversion of the substrate by the enzyme. The proposed\nmechanism is stable and robust and the higher the number of modification sites,\nthe greater the stability. We show that a high number of modification sites\nconverts a fast reaction into a slow process, and the slowing down depends on\nthe number of sites and may span many orders of magnitude; in this way\nmultisite modification of proteins stands out as a general mechanism that\nallows the transfer of information from the very short time scales of enzyme\nreactions (milliseconds) to the long time scale of cell response (hours).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2006 18:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
