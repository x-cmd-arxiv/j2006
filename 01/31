Without\ncorrections for the effects of beam convolution and sensitivity to GMC\nproperties, the resulting properties may be severely biased. This is\nparticularly true for extragalactic observations, where resolution and\nsensitivity effects often bias measured values by 40% or more. We correct for\nfinite spatial and spectral resolutions with a simple deconvolution and we\ncorrect for sensitivity biases by extrapolating properties of a GMC to those we\nwould expect to measure with perfect sensitivity.

The access graph has to be known\nin advance to the paging algorithm and the memory required to represent the\naccess graph itself may be very large.\n  In this paper we present truly online strongly competitive paging algorithms\nin the access graph model that do not have any prior information on the access\nsequence.

In particular, the Ronkin\nfunction realizes an integration of thermodynamical density of the main\ndiagonal partitions, along one-dimensional slice of it and thereby is\ninterpreted as the counting function of gauge instantons. The radius of $S^1$\ncan be identified with the inverse temperature of the statistical model. The\nlarge radius limit of the five-dimensional Yang-Mills is the low temperature\nlimit of the statistical model, where the statistical model is frozen to a\nground state that is associated with the local SU(N) geometry. We also show\nthat the low temperature limit corresponds to a certain degeneration of amoebas\nand the Ronkin functions known as tropical geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2006 11:58:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 03:03:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

VWK consists of the Thomas-Fermi part plus a\npure, perturbative hbar^2 correction. In external potentials, VWK passes\nthrough the average of the quantal values of the accumulated level density and\ntotal energy as a function of the Fermi energy. However, there is a problem of\noverbinding when the energy per particle is displayed as a function of the\nparticle number. The situation is analyzed comparing spherical and deformed\nharmonic oscillator potentials. In the self-consistent case, we show for Skyrme\nforces that VWK binding energies are very close to those obtained from extended\nThomas-Fermi functionals of hbar^4 order, pointing to the rapid convergence of\nthe VWK theory. This satisfying result, however, does not cure the overbinding\nproblem, i.e., the semiclassical energies show more binding than they should.\nThis feature is more pronounced in the case of Skyrme forces than with the\nrelativistic mean field approach.

A 73, 053809 (2006)","doi":"10.1103/PhysRevA.73.053809","report-no":null,"categories":"quant-ph","license":null,"abstract":"  An ensemble of multilevel atoms is a good candidate for a quantum information\nstorage device. The information is encrypted in the collective ground state\natomic coherence, which, in the absence of external excitation, is decoupled\nfrom the vacuum and therefore decoherence free. However, in the process of\nmanipulation of atoms with light pulses (writing, reading), one inadvertently\nintroduces a coupling to the environment, i.e. a source of decoherence. The\ndissipation process is often treated as an independent process for each atom in\nthe ensemble, an approach which fails at large atomic optical depths where\ncooperative effects must be taken into account. In this paper, the cooperative\nbehavior of spin decoherence and population transfer for a system of two,\ndriven multilevel-atoms is studied. Not surprisingly, an enhancement in the\ndecoherence rate is found, when the atoms are separated by a distance that is\nsmall compared to an optical wavelength; however, it is found that this rate\nincreases even further for somewhat larger separations for atoms aligned along\nthe direction of the driving field's propagation vector. A treatment of the\ncooperative modification of optical pumping rates and an effect of polarization\nswapping between atoms is also discussed, lending additional insight into the\norigin of the collective decay.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2006 19:45:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

The demonstrated hidden variables are precisely those needed\nfor the derivation of the Bell Inequalities. We thus refute the widespread view\nthat empirical violations of Bell Inequalities leave open a choice of whether\nto reject (i) locality or (ii) hidden variables. Both principles are indeed\nassumed in the derivation of the inequalities, but since, as we demonstrate\nhere, (ii) actually follows from (i), there is no choice but to blame the\nviolation of Bell's Inequality on (i). Our main conclusion is thus that no Bell\nLocal theory can be consistent with what is known from experiment about the\ncorrelations exhibited by separated particles. Aside from our conclusion being\nbased on a different sense of locality this conclusion resembles one that has\nbeen advocated recently by H.P. Stapp. We therefore also carefully contrast the\nargument presented here to that proposed by Stapp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2006 21:34:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jul 2006 15:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
