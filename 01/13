For a survey that covers about 200 sq. deg. both in SZ and weak lensing\nobservations, the slope and amplitude of the mass vs. SZ luminosity relation\ncan be measured with few percent error for clusters at z~0.5. This can be used\nto constrain cluster physics, such as the nature of feedback. For example, we\ncan distinguish a pre-heated model from a model with a decreased accretion rate\nat more than 5sigma. The power to discriminate among different\nnon-gravitational processes in the ICM becomes even stronger if we use the\ncentral Compton parameter y_0, which could allow one to distinguish between\nmodels with pre-heating, SN feedback and AGN feedback, for example, at more\nthan 5sigma. Measurement of these scaling relations as a function of redshift\nmakes it possible to directly observe e.g., the evolution of the hot gas in\nclusters. With this approach the mass-L_SZ relation can be calibrated and its\nuncertainties can be quantified, leading to a more robust determination of\ncosmological parameters from clusters surveys. The mass-L_SZ relation\ncalibrated in this way from a small area of the sky can be used to determine\nmasses of SZ clusters from very large SZ-only surveys and is nicely\ncomplementary to other techniques proposed in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2006 20:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

These dwarf nova oscillations (DNOs) increase in\nperiod until they reach 33 s, when a transition to a strong 1st harmonic and\nweak fundamental takes place. After further period increase the 2nd harmonic\nappears; often all three components are present simultaneously. This 1:2:3\nfrequency suite is similar to what has been seen in some neutron star and black\nhole X-Ray binaries, but has not previously been seen in a cataclysmic\nvariable. When studied in detail the fundamental and 2nd harmonic vary\nsimilarly in phase, but the 1st harmonic behaves independently, though keeping\nclose to twice the frequency of the fundamental. The fundamental period of the\nDNOs, as directly observed or inferred from the harmonics, increases to ~100 s\nbefore the oscillation disappears as the star reaches quiescence. Its maximum\nperiod is close to that of the `longer period' DNOs observed in VW Hyi. The\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), which have fundamental periods 400 -- 1000\ns, behave in the same way, showing 1st and 2nd harmonics at approximately the\nsame times as the DNOs. We explore some possible models. One in which the\nexistence of the 1st harmonic is due to transition from viewing a single\naccretion region to viewing two regions, and the rate of accretion onto the\nprimary is modulated at the frequency of the 1st harmonic, as in the `beat\nfrequency model', can generate the suite of DNO frequencies observed. But the\nbehaviour of the QPOs is not yet understood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2006 10:10:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Because it is a lifetime associated with both forward\n(transmitted) and backward (reflected) fluxes, it cannot be used to define a\ngroup velocity for forward transit in cases where a wavepacket is mostly\nreflected. For photonic tunneling barriers the group delay is identical to the\ndwell time which is also a property of an entire wave function with reflected\nand transmitted components. Theoretical predictions and experimental reports of\nsuperluminal group velocities in barrier tunneling are re-interpreted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2006 23:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Polarization\nentanglement is produced by simultaneously pumping a loop of standard\ndispersion-shifted fiber with two orthogonally-polarized pump pulses, one\npropagating in the clockwise and the other in the counter-clockwise direction.\nWe characterize this source by investigating two-photon interference between\nthe generated signal-idler photon-pairs under various conditions. The\nexperimental parameters are carefully optimized to maximize the generated\nphoton-pair correlation and to minimize contamination of the entangled\nphoton-pairs from extraneously scattered background photons that are produced\nby the pump pulses for two reasons: i) spontaneous Raman scattering causes\nuncorrelated photons to be emitted in the signal/idler bands and ii) broadening\nof the pump-pulse spectrum due to self-phase modulation causes pump photons to\nleak into the signal/idler bands. We obtain two-photon interference with\nvisibility $>90$% without subtracting counts caused by the background photons\n(only dark counts of the detectors are subtracted), when the mean photon number\nin the signal (idler) channel is about 0.02/pulse, while no interference is\nobserved in direct detection of either the signal or the idler photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2006 03:27:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A typical example is\ncloning; making a copy of digital information is straightforward but it is not\npossible exactly for quantum information. The question in this paper is whether\nor not quantum network coding is possible. Its classical counterpart is another\ngood example to show that digital information flow can be done much more\nefficiently than conventional (say, liquid) flow.\n  Our answer to the question is similar to the case of cloning, namely, it is\nshown that quantum network coding is possible if approximation is allowed, by\nusing a simple network model called Butterfly. In this network, there are two\nflow paths, s_1 to t_1 and s_2 to t_2, which shares a single bottleneck channel\nof capacity one. In the classical case, we can send two bits simultaneously,\none for each path, in spite of the bottleneck. Our results for quantum network\ncoding include: (i) We can send any quantum state |psi_1> from s_1 to t_1 and\n|psi_2> from s_2 to t_2 simultaneously with a fidelity strictly greater than\n1/2. (ii) If one of |psi_1> and |psi_2> is classical, then the fidelity can be\nimproved to 2/3. (iii) Similar improvement is also possible if |psi_1> and\n|psi_2> are restricted to only a finite number of (previously known) states.\n(iv) Several impossibility results including the general upper bound of the\nfidelity are also given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Jan 2006 07:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Dec 2006 04:12:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-05-24"}
