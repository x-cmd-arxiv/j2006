While these are\nstatic, dynamic spirals can also be observed in excitable systems such as heart\ntissue, retina, certain chemical reactions, slime mold aggregates, flame\nfronts, etc. The images associated with these spirals are often breathtaking,\nbut spirals have also been linked to cardiac arrhythmias, a potentially fatal\nheart ailment.\n  In the literature, very specific models depending on the excitable system of\ninterest are used to explain the observed behaviour of spirals (such as\nanchoring or drifting). Barkley first noticed that the Euclidean symmetry of\nthese models, and not the model itself, is responsible for the observed\nbehaviour. But in experiments, the physical domain is never Euclidean. The\nheart, for instance, is finite, anisotropic and littered with inhomogeneities.\nTo capture this loss of symmetry, LeBlanc and Wulff introduced forced Euclidean\nsymmetry-breaking (FESB) in the analysis.\n  To accurately model the physical situation, two basic types of\nsymmetry-breaking perturbations are used: translational symmetry-breaking (TSB)\nand rotational symmetry-breaking (RSB) terms.

Chen Zida has\nfounded that the definition of vortex, based on the Stokes decomposition,\ncannot well describe the local rotation when the velocity gradient is highly\nasymmetric. Chen reformulates the Stokes S+R decomposition into a general S+R\ndecomposition. By further extending Chen results, this research studies the\nmotion equation of fluid for the case where highly asymmetric velocity gradient\nis exhibited. The result shows that the classical NS equation does not meet the\nrequirement of angular momentum conservation, which is apparently ignored for\ninfinitesimal velocity gradient of fluid. This paper reformulates the intrinsic\ngeometric description of fluid motion and two additional equations are\nintroduced. Combining with the classical NS equation, the reformulated motion\nequations are in closed-form. The research shows that the NS equation is good\napproximation for average flow, so it can not solve the turbulent problem in\nessential sense. However, this conclusion does not deny that with suitable\nadditional condition for special engineering problem it is still a would-be\nacceptable approximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2006 06:25:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
