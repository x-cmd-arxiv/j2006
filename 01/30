In common with previous authors, we develop a one-zone model for the\nlocal disc structure. We agree that radial heat advection plays an important\nrole in determining the inner disc structure, and also find limit-cycle\nbehaviour. When the stochastic magnetic dynamo model of King et al. (2004) is\nadded to these models, we find similar variability behaviour to before.\n  We are now better placed to put physical constraints on model parameters. In\nparticular, we find that in order to be consistent with the low degree of\nvariability seen in the thermal disc component of black hole binaries, we need\nto limit the energy density of the poloidal field that can be produced by local\ndynamo cells in the disc to less than a few percent of the energy density of\nthe dynamo field within the disc itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Jan 2006 20:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Four of the galaxies in our sample\nexhibit unusual kinematic signatures, such as non-circular motions.

We also\ncarried out detailed magnetic measurements over a temperature regime 2-300 K\nunder a magnetic field 100-10000 Oe both on bulk and nano-crystalline systems.\nWhile in the bulk system a sharp endothermic peak at T_N together with a broad\nfeature, ranging over nearly ~150 K (Delta_T), could be observed in\ncalorimetry, the nanoscale systems exhibit only the broad feature. The\ncharacteristic dielectric anomaly, expected at T_N, is found to occur both at\nT_O and T_N across Delta_T in the bulk sample. The Maxwell-Wagner component due\nto interfaces between heterogenous regions with different conductivities is\nalso present. The magnetic properties, measured at lower temperature,\ncorroborate our observations in calorimetry. The metastability increases in the\nnanoscale BiFeO3 with divergence between zero-field cooled (ZFC) and field\ncooled (FC) magnetization below ~100 K and faster magnetic relaxation.\nInterestingly, in nanoscale BiFeO3, one also observes finite coercivity at\nlower temperature which points out that suitable design of particle size and\nshape may induce ferromagnetism. The inhomogeneous distribution of Bi/Fe-ions\nand/or oxygen non-stoichiometry seems to be giving rise to broad features in\nthermal, magnetic as well as in electrical responses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2006 13:09:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We perform NLO and\nNNLO analyses which include the reduced cross section HERA data at high y, as\nwell as earlier direct measurements of F_L. We find that the NNLO analysis\ngives a better description of F_L at low x than that performed at NLO.\nNevertheless the data show evidence of the need of further contributions to\nF_L, which may be of higher-twist origin. We study such corrections both\nphenomenologically and theoretically via a renormalon approach. The\nhigher-twist corrections extracted from a successful fit to the data are in\ngeneral agreement with the theoretical expectations, but there is still room\nfor alternative theoretical contributions, particularly at low x and Q^2. The\nimportance of future measurements of F_L is emphasized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Jan 2006 11:59:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2006 15:28:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

It is well known that in the original fermion space, it is\nalmost impossible to introduce any trial state for the variation except the BCS\nstate in the framework of the mean field approximation. However, in the\nSchwinger boson representation, various trial states can be defined on the\ncondition that the mean field approximation is useful.

Since the number of qubits must be\nfinite, we cannot solve continuous problems on a quantum computer with infinite\nworst case information complexity. This can even happen for continuous problems\nwith small randomized complexity on a classical computer. A simple example is\nintegration of bounded continuous functions. To overcome this bad property that\nlimits the power of quantum computation for continuous problems, we study the\nquantum setting in which randomized queries are allowed.
