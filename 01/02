The models\nare constructed following Gould & Morgan (2003) by populating the line of sight\nwith stars drawn from the Hipparcos catalog. Using these, we demonstrate that\nthe number of stars with sensitivity to HJs and VHJs is only 4--16% of those in\nthe OGLE-III fields satisfying the spectroscopic-followup limit of V_max<17.5.\nHence, the frequencies we derive are much higher than a naive estimate would\nindicate. We find that at 90% confidence the fraction of stars with planets in\nthe two period ranges is (1/310)(1^{+1.39}_{-0.59}) for HJs and\n(1/690)(1^{+1.10}_{-0.54}) for VHJs. The HJ rate is statistically\nindistinguishable from that found in radial velocity (RV) studies. However, we\nnote that magnitude-limited RV samples are heavily biased toward metal-rich\n(hence, planet-bearing) stars, while transit surveys are not, and therefore we\nexpect that more sensitive transit surveys should find a deficit of HJs as\ncompared to RV surveys. The detection of 3 transiting VHJs, all with periods\nless than 2 days, is marginally consistent with the complete absence of such\ndetections in RV surveys. The planets detected are consistent with being\nuniformly distributed between 1.00 and 1.25 Jovian radii, but there are too few\nin the sample to map this distribution in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2006 14:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

Here we show that\nthis interpretation is in sharp contradiction with the conventional magnetar\nmodel. Firstly, we show that a magnetar crustal mode decays on the timescale of\nat most a second due to the emission of Alfven waves into the neutron-star\ninterior. A possible modification is then to assume that the QPOs are\nassociated with the magnetars' global modes. However, we argue that at the\nfrequencies of the observed QPOs, the neutron-star core is likely to support a\ncontinuum of Magneto-Hydrodynamic (MHD) normal modes. We demonstrate this on a\ncompletely solvable toy model which captures the essential physics of the\nsystem. We then show that the frequency of the global mode of the whole star is\nlikely to have a significant imaginary component, and its amplitude is likely\nto decay on a short timescale. This is not observed. Thus we conclude that\neither (i) the origin of the QPO is in the magnetar's magnetosphere, or (ii)\nthe magnetic field has a special configuration: either it is expelled from the\nmagnetar's core prior to the flares, or its poloidal component has very small\ncoherence length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2006 02:51:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2006 13:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We find that the dispersion in a STIS\naperture of ~0.1''-0.2'' generally exceeds the large-scale stellar velocity\ndispersion of the galaxy. This is qualitatively consistent with the presence of\ncentral BHs, but raises the question whether the excess gas dispersion is of\ngravitational or non-gravitational origin and whether the implied BH masses are\nconsistent with our current understanding of BH demography(as predicted by the\nM-sigma relation between BH mass and stellar velocity dispersion). To address\nthis we construct dynamical models for the gas, both thin disk models and\nmodels with more general axis ratios and velocity anisotropies. For the normal\ngalaxies the nuclear gas dispersions are adequately reproduced assuming disks\naround BHs with masses that follow the M-sigma relation. In contrast, the gas\ndispersions observed for the radio galaxies generally exceed those predicted by\nany of the models. We attribute this to the presence of non-gravitational\nmotions in the gas that are similar to or larger than the gravitational\nmotions. The non- gravitational motions are presumably driven by the active\ngalactic nucleus (AGN), but we do not find a relation between the radiative\noutput of the AGN and the non-gravitational dispersion.

However, the microscopic interactions between fermions are\npotentially quite complex, and experiments in ultracold gases to date cannot\nclearly distinguish between the qualitatively different microscopic models that\nhave been proposed. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that optical\nmeasurements of electron spin noise -- the intrinsic, random fluctuations of\nspin -- can probe the entangled quantum states of ultracold fermionic atomic\ngases and unambiguously reveal the detailed nature of the interatomic\ninteractions. We show that different models predict different sets of\nresonances in the noise spectrum, and once the correct effective interatomic\ninteraction model is identified, the line-shapes of the spin noise can be used\nto constrain this model. Further, experimental measurements of spin noise in\nclassical (Boltzmann) alkali vapors are used to estimate the expected signal\nmagnitudes for spin noise measurements in ultracold atom systems and to show\nthat these measurements are feasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Jan 2006 19:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This paper considers a very simple adaptive\nalgorithm, based on controlling only the drift component of a time-step.

This possibility must be quantified and shown to have low\nprobability.\n  The primary issue in the stability analysis is ergodicity. It is assumed that\nthe noise is non-degenerate, so that the diffusion process is elliptic, and the\ndrift is assumed to satisfy a coercivity condition. The SDE is then\ngeometrically ergodic (converges to statistical equilibrium exponentially\nquickly). If the drift is not linearly bounded then explicit fixed time-step\napproximations, such as the Euler-Maruyama scheme, may fail to be ergodic.

The problem of dynamical inference in these general settings is\nchallenging researchers for decades.
