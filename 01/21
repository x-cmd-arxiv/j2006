At this redshift the isotropic-equivalent\nprompt energy release was about 1.5 x 10^51 erg, and using the standard\nafterglow synchrotron model we find that the blastwave kinetic energy is\nsimilar, E_K,iso ~ 8.4 x 10^51 erg. An observed jet break at t ~ 5 days\nindicates that the opening angle is ~ 7 degrees and the total beaming-corrected\nenergy is therefore ~ 2.5 x 10^49 erg, comparable to the values inferred for\nprevious short GRBs. We further show that the burst experienced an episode of\nenergy injection by a factor of 3.4 between t=1.4 and 3.4 hours, which was\naccompanied by reverse shock emission in the radio band. This result provides\ncontinued evidence that the central engines of short GRBs may be active\nsignificantly longer than the duration of the burst and/or produce a wide range\nof Lorentz factors. Finally, we show that the host galaxy of GRB051221a is\nactively forming stars at a rate of about 1.6 M_solar/yr, but at the same time\nexhibits evidence for an appreciable population of old stars (~ 1 Gyr) and near\nsolar metallicity. The lack of bright supernova emission and the low\ncircumburst density (n ~ 10^-3 cm^-3) continue to support the idea that short\nbursts are not related to the death of massive stars and are instead consistent\nwith a compact object merger. Given that the total energy release is a factor\nof ~ 10 larger than the predicted yield for a neutrino annihilation mechanism,\nthis suggests that magnetohydrodynamic processes may be required to power the\nburst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Jan 2006 17:47:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2006 22:34:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2006 17:32:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-05-12"}

The 3-30\nkeV PCA spectra and the 15-50 keV HEXTE spectra were analyzed jointly for the\ncyclotron resonance features. When the 3-50 keV luminosity at an assumed\ndistance of 7 kpc was in the range (5-13)x10^{37} erg s^{-1}, harmonic double\ncyclotron features were observed in absorption at ~11 and ~22 keV, as was\nmeasured previously during typical outbursts. As the luminosity decreased below\n\\~5x10^{37} erg s^{-1}, the second resonance disappeared, and the fundamental\nresonance energy gradually increased, up to $\\sim$16 keV at 0.16x10^{37} erg\ns^{-1}. These results reconfirm the report by Mihara et al. (2004) using Ginga,\nwho observed a single absorption at ~16 keV in a minor (~10^{37} erg s^{-1})\noutburst of this object. The luminosity-dependent cyclotron resonance energy\nmay be understood as a result of a decrease in the accretion column height, in\nresponse to a decrease in the mass accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2006 07:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

This is motivated\nby the application of metal foams in compact heat-transfer devices, or as\ncatalyst substrates in process-engineering. The flow-consequences of such\ncomplicated objects are incorporated by adding explicit multiscale forcing to\nthe Navier-Stokes equations. The forcing represents the simultaneous agitation\nof a wide spectrum of length-scales when flow passes through the complex\nobject. It is found that a considerable modulation of the traditional energy\ncascading can be introduced with a specific forcing strategy. In spectral\nspace, forcing yields strongly localized deviations from the common Kolmogorov\nscaling law, directly associated with the explicitly forced scales. In\naddition, the accumulated effect of forcing induces a significant non-local\nalteration of the kinetic energy including the spectrum for the large scales.\nConsequently, a manipulation of turbulent flow can be achieved over an extended\nrange, well beyond the directly forced scales. The turbulent mixing of a\npassive scalar field is also investigated, in order to quantify the\nphysical-space modifications of transport processes in multiscale forced\nturbulence. The surface-area and wrinkling of level-sets of the scalar field\nare monitored as measures of the influence of explicit forcing on the local and\nglobal mixing efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2006 03:35:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
