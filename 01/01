The models reproduce many observed characteristics of the\nGalaxy such as global circulation of gas (i.e., galactic fountain) and the\nexistence of cold dense clouds in the galactic disk. Global quantities of the\nmodel such as warm and hot gas filling factors in the midplane, mass fraction\nof thermally unstable gas, and the averaged vertical density profile are\ncompared directly with existing observations, and shown to be broadly\nconsistent. We find that energy injection occurs over a broad range of scales.\nThere is no single effective driving scale, unlike the usual assumption for\nidealized models of incompressible turbulence. However, >90% of the total\nkinetic energy is contained in wavelengths shortward of 200 pc. The shape of\nthe kinetic energy spectrum differs substantially from that of the velocity\npower spectrum, which implies that the velocity structure varies with the gas\ndensity. Velocity structure functions demonstrate that the phenomenological\ntheory proposed by Boldyrev is applicable to the medium. We show that it can be\nmisleading to predict physical properties such as the stellar initial mass\nfunction based on numerical simulations that do not include self-gravity of the\ngas. Even if all the gas in turbulently Jeans unstable regions in our\nsimulation is assumed to collapse and form stars in local freefall times, the\nresulting total collapse rate is significantly lower than the value consistent\nwith the input supernova rate.
