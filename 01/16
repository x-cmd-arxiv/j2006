This over estimate results from a delay in mergers\nthat lead to formation of more massive haloes. The same technique can be used\nto study corrections to other physical quantities.

For random walk\nmodels, we explain, on the specific examples of the Sinai model and of the trap\nmodel, how disorder induces anomalous diffusion, aging behaviours and Golosov\nlocalization, and how these properties can be understood via a strong disorder\nrenormalization approach. For polymer models, we discuss the critical\nproperties of various delocalization transitions involving random polymers. We\nfirst summarize some recent progresses in the general theory of random critical\npoints : thermodynamic observables are not self-averaging at criticality\nwhenever disorder is relevant, and this lack of self-averaging is directly\nrelated to the probability distribution of pseudo-critical temperatures\n$T_c(i,L)$ over the ensemble of samples $(i)$ of size $L$. We describe the\nresults of this analysis for the bidimensional wetting and for the\nPoland-Scheraga model of DNA denaturation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2006 09:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

With the irreducible (Hawking) mass\nas the measure of energy, the conservation laws of energy and angular momentum\ntake a similar form, expressing the rate of change of mass and angular momentum\nof a black hole in terms of fluxes of energy and angular momentum, obtained\nfrom the matter energy tensor and an effective energy tensor for gravitational\nradiation.

A generalization of the \"zeroth law\" to local equilibrium follows.\nCombined with an existing version of the \"second law\", all the key quantities\nand laws of the classical paradigm for black holes (in terms of Killing or\nevent horizons) have now been formulated coherently in a general dynamical\nparadigm in terms of trapping horizons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Jan 2006 22:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
