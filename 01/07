We make direct comparisons to our\nanalytic theory (Weinberg & Katz 2005) to demonstrate the great difficulty that\nan N-body simulation has representing these dynamics for realistic astronomical\ninteractions. In a dark-matter halo, the bar's angular momentum is coupled to\nthe central density cusp (if present) by the Inner Lindblad Resonance. Owing to\nthis angular momentum transfer and self-consistent re-equilibration, strong\nrealistic bars WILL modify the cusp profile, lowering the central densities\nwithin about 30% of the bar radius in a few bar orbits. Past results to the\ncontrary (Sellwood 2006, McMillan & Dehnen 2005) may be the result of weak bars\nor numerical artifacts. The magnitude depends on many factors and we illustrate\nthe sensitivity of the response to the dark-matter profile, the bar shape and\nmass, and the galaxy's evolutionary history. For example, if the bar length is\ncomparable to the size of a central dark-matter core, the bar may exchange\nangular momentum without changing its pattern speed significantly.

The RMF results show that the shell effects at\nN=126 remain strong and exhibit only a slight reduction in the strength in\ngoing from the r-process path to the neutron drip line. This is in striking\ncontrast to a systematic weakening of the shell effects at N=82 in the\nr-process region predicted earlier in the similar approach. In comparison the\nshell effects with microscopic-macroscopic mass formulae show a near constancy\nof shell gaps leading to strong shell effects in the region of r-process path\nto the drip line. A recent analysis of solar-system r-process abundances in a\nprompt supernova explosion model using various mass formulae including the\nrecently introduced mass tables based upon HFB approach shows that whilst mass\nformulae with weak shell effects at N=126 give rise to a spread and an\noverproduction of nuclides near the third abundance peak at A~190, mass tables\nwith droplet models showing stronger shell effects are able to reproduce the\nabundance features near the third peak appropriately. In comparison, several\nanalyses of the second r-process peak at A~130 have required weakened shell\neffects at N=82. Our predictions in the RMF theory with NL-SV1, which exhibit\nweaker shell effects at N=82 and stronger one at N=126 in the r-process region,\nsupport the conjecture that a different nature of the shell effects at the\nmagic numbers may be at play in r-process nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Jan 2006 20:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
