This has been interpreted as reflecting\nenergy injection. When combined with previous estimates, which have concluded\nthat the kinetic energy of the late ($\\gtrsim 10$ hr) afterglow is comparable\nto the energy emitted in gamma-rays, this interpretation implies very high\nvalues of $\\epsilon_\\gamma \\gtrsim 0.9$.

These features\nallow us to evaluate the number of different topologies the bonding pattern can\nadopt.

To gain insights into these\ninteractions, a mathematical model was developed for L-LTP induction in the CA1\nregion of the hippocampus. The differential equation-based model represents\nactions of protein kinase A (PKA), MAP kinase (MAPK), and CaM kinase II\n(CAMKII) in the vicinity of the synapse, and activation of transcription by CaM\nkinase IV (CAMKIV) and MAPK. L-LTP is represented by increases in a synaptic\nweight. Simulations suggest that steep, supralinear stimulus-response\nrelationships between stimuli (elevations in [Ca2+]) and kinase activation are\nessential for translating brief stimuli into long-lasting gene activation and\nsynaptic weight increases. Convergence of multiple kinase activities to induce\nL-LTP helps to generate a threshold whereby the amount of L-LTP varies steeply\nwith the number of tetanic electrical stimuli. The model simulates tetanic,\ntheta-burst, pairing-induced, and chemical L-LTP, as well as L-LTP due to\nsynaptic tagging. The model also simulates inhibition of L-LTP by inhibition of\nMAPK, CAMKII, PKA, or CAMKIV. The model predicts results of experiments to\ndelineate mechanisms underlying L-LTP induction and expression. For example,\nthe cAMP antagonist RpcAMPs, which inhibits L-LTP induction, is predicted to\ninhibit ERK activation. The model also appears useful to clarify similarities\nand differences between hippocampal L-LTP and long-term synaptic strengthening\nin other systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Jan 2006 23:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
