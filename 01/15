This review summarizes the major nucleosynthesis results\nobtained with INTEGRAL so far. Positron annihilation in our Galaxy is being\nstudied in unprecented detail. SPI observations yield the first sky maps in\nboth the 511 keV annihilation line and the positronium continuum emission, and\nthe most accurate spectrum at 511 keV to date, thereby imposing new constraints\non the source(s) of Galactic positrons which still remain(s) unidentified.

SPI also provided the most accurate\ndetermination of the gamma-ray line flux due to the decay of 60Fe. The combined\nresults for 26Al and 60Fe have important implications for nucleosynthesis in\nmassive stars, in particular Wolf-Rayet stars. Both IBIS and SPI are searching\nthe Galactic plane for young supernova remnants emitting the gamma-ray lines\nassociated with radioactive 44Ti.

While this at first may seem evident,\nto our knowledge, so far no theoretical argument has been presented explaining\nthis relationship explicitly. In here, we therefore develop a conceptual\nframework based on the universal scaling law and then support our conjecture\nthrough evaluation with experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Jan 2006 16:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
