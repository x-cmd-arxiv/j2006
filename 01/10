Specifically, we investigate the properties of shell\nconvection at a time immediately before the He- luminosity peak during the 15th\nthermal pulse of a stellar evolution track with initially two solar masses and\nmetallicity Z=0.01. This choice is a representative example of a low-mass\nasymptotic giant branch thermal pulse. We construct the initial vertical\nstratification with a set of polytropes to resemble the stellar evolution\nstructure. Convection is driven by a constant volume heating in a thin layer at\nthe bottom of the unstable layer. We calculate a grid of 2D simulations with\ndifferent resolutions and heating rates. Our set of simulations includes one\nlow-resolution 3D run. The computational domain includes 11.4 pressure scale\nheights. He-shell flash convection is dominated by large convective cells that\nare centered in the lower half of the convection zone. Convective rolls have an\nalmost circular appearance because focusing mechanisms exist in the form of the\ndensity stratification for downdrafts and the heating of localized eddies that\ngenerate upflows. Nevertheless, downdrafts appear to be somewhat more focused.\nThe He-shell flash convection generates a rich spectrum of gravity waves in\nboth stable layers above and beneath the convective shell. The magnitude of the\nconvective velocities from our 1D mixing-length theory model and the\nrms-averaged vertical velocities from the hydrodynamic model are consistent\nwithin a factor of a few. However, the velocity profile in the hydrodynamic\nsimulation is more asymmetric, and decays exponentially inside the convection\nzone.

Most authors seem to equate this issue with the one\nof finding the maximum value of the modularity, as defined by Newman. Since the\nproblem formulated this way is NP-hard, most effort has gone into the\nconstruction of search algorithms, and less to the question of other measures\nof community structures, similarities between various partitionings and the\nvalidation with respect to external information. Here we concentrate on a class\nof computer generated networks and on three well-studied real networks which\nconstitute a bench-mark for network studies; the karate club, the US college\nfootball teams and a gene network of yeast. We utilize some standard ways of\nclustering data (originally not designed for finding community structures in\nnetworks) and show that these classical methods sometimes outperform the newer\nones. We discuss various measures of the strength of the modular structure, and\nshow by examples features and drawbacks. Further, we compare different\npartitions by applying some graph-theoretic concepts of distance, which\nindicate that one of the quality measures of the degree of modularity\ncorresponds quite well with the distance from the true partition. Finally, we\nintroduce a way to validate the partitionings with respect to external data\nwhen the nodes are classified but the network structure is unknown. This is\nhere possible since we know everything of the computer generated networks, as\nwell as the historical answer to how the karate club and the football teams are\npartitioned in reality. The partitioning of the gene network is validated by\nuse of the Gene Ontology database, where we show that a community in general\ncorresponds to a biological process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2006 08:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

However, a classical\nirreversible system cannot be consistently decomposed into a finite number of\nreversible quantum particles (and, vice versa), thus establishing that the\norigin of irreversibility is basically unknown at the dawn of the 21-th\ncentury. To resolve this problem, we adopt the historical an- alytic\nrepresentation of irreversibility by Lagrange and Hamilton with external terms\nin their analytic equations; we show that, when properly written, the brackets\nof the time evolution characterize covering Lie-admissible algebras; we show\nthat the for- malism has a fully consistent operator counterpart given by the\nLie-admissible branch of hadronic mechanics; we identify catastrophic\nmathematical and physical inconsis- tencies when irreversible formulations are\ntreated with the conventional mathematics used for reversible systems; and show\nthat, when the dynamical equations are treated with a novel irreversible\nmathematics, Lie-admissible formulations are fully consistent because invariant\nat both the classical and operator level. The case of closed-isolated systems\nverifying conventional total conservation laws, yet possessing an irreversible\nstructure, is treated via the Lie-isotopic subclass of Lie-admissible\nformulations.
