This question has assumed some importance in recent\nyears due to the advent of nano technology and the growing use of nanometer\nscale devices and structures. In a small system, the size limits the scale of\nthe fluctuations and makes it imperative for us to understand how the response\nof the system is altered in such a situation. In this thesis, this question is\nanswered for the special case of interfacial fluctuations in two dimensions\n(2d). The energy of an interface between two phases in equilibrium is invariant\nwith respect to translations perpendicular to the plane (or line in 2d) of the\ninterface. We study the consequence of breaking this symmetry explicity using\nan external field gradient. One expects that since low energy excitations are\nsuppressed, the interface would be flat and inert at all times. We show that\nsurprisingly there are novel fluctuations and phenomena associated with such\nconstrained interfaces which have static as well as dynamic consequences. The\nIsing interface on a square lattice is shown to undergo a multitude of\nstructural transitions as a function of velocity and the orientation. Liquid\nsolid interfaces show coherent addition and removal of atomic layers providing\nnovel mechanisms of stress relaxation in a nanosized single crystal without\ndefects. We study momentum and energy transfer across the liquid solid\ninterface in the presence of this ``layering'' transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2006 05:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The stability\nof the different phases is found to depend mainly on the volume and on the\namount of magnetic order, confirming previous experimental findings and\nphenomenological models. It is generally found that for large lattice constants\nthe ferromagnetic state is favored, whereas for small lattice constants\ndifferent antiferromagnetic states can be stabilized. In the ferromagnetic\nstate the structure with minimal energy is always hexagonal, whereas it becomes\northorhombically distorted if there is an antiferromagnetic component in the\nhexagonal plane. For the paramagnetic state the stable cell is found to be\northorhombic up to a critical lattice constant of about 3.7 Angstrom, above\nwhich it remains hexagonal. This leads to the second order structural phase\ntransition between paramagnetic states at about 400 K, where the lattice\nparameter increases above this critical value with rising temperature due to\nthe thermal expansion. For the paramagnetic state an analytic approximation for\nthe magnitude of the orthorhombic distortion as a function of the lattice\nconstant is given. Within the mean field approximation the dependence of the\nCurie temperature on the volume and on the orthorhombic distortion is\ncalculated. For orthorhombically distorted cells the Curie temperature is much\nsmaller than for hexagonal cells. This is mainly due to the fact that some of\nthe exchange coupling constants in the hexagonal plane become negative for\ndistorted cells. With these results a description of the susceptibility as\nfunction of temperature is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2006 10:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Recently, many theoretical efforts have been made on\nthis topic and have theoretically predicted the high performance of decoy\nmethod. However, the gap between theory and experiment remains open. In this\npaper, we report the first experiments on decoy state QKD, thus bridging the\ngap. Two protocols of decoy state QKD are implemented: one-decoy protocol over\n15km of standard telecom fiber, and weak+vacuum protocol over 60km of standard\ntelecom fiber. We implemented the decoy state method on a modified commercial\nQKD system. The modification we made is simply adding commercial acousto-optic\nmodulator (AOM) on the QKD system. The AOM is used to modulate the intensity of\neach signal individually, thus implementing the decoy state method. As an\nimportant part of implementation, numerical simulation of our set-up is also\nperformed. The simulation shows that standard security proofs give a zero key\ngeneration rate at the distance we perform decoy state QKD (both 15km and\n60km). Therefore decoy state QKD is necessary for long distance secure\ncommunication. Our implementation shows explicitly the power and feasibility of\ndecoy method, and brings it to our real-life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2006 03:53:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Oct 2006 15:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-11-17"}
