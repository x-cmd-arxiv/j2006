From\nthe scatter about the CMR, a mean luminosity--weighted age t > 3.3 Gyr (z > 3)\nis derived for the elliptical galaxies.\n  Strikingly, the S0 galaxies in RDCS J0910+5422 are systematically bluer in\n(i_775 - z_850) by 0.07 +/- 0.02 mag, with respect to the ellipticals. The\nellipticity distribution as a function of color indicates that the face-on S0s\nin this particular cluster have likely been classified as elliptical. Thus, if\nanything, the offset in color between the elliptical and S0 populations may be\neven more significant.\n  The color offset between S0 and E corresponds to an age difference of ~1 Gyr,\nfor a single-burst solar metallicity model. A solar metallicity model with an\nexponential decay in star formation will reproduce the offset for an age of 3.5\nGyr, i.e. the S0s have evolved gradually from star forming progenitors.\n  The early--type population in this cluster appears to be still forming. The\nblue early-type disk galaxies in RDCS J0910+5422 likely represent the direct\nprogenitors of the more evolved S0s that follow the same red sequence as\nellipticals in other clusters.\n  Thirteen red galaxy pairs are observed and the galaxies associated in pairs\nconstitute ~40% of the CMR galaxies in this cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2006 19:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In projection, NFW models resemble Sersic models, but with a\nvery narrow range of shapes (m=3+/-1). The total density profile of Es cannot\nbe NFW-like because the predicted local M/L and aperture velocity dispersion\nwithin an effective radius (Re) are much lower than observed. Stars must then\ndominate Es out to a few Re. Fitting an NFW model to the total density profile\nof Sersic+NFW (stars+dark matter [DM]) Es results in very high concentration\nparameters, as found by X-ray observers. Kinematical modeling of Es assuming an\nisotropic NFW DM model underestimates M/L at the virial radius by a factor of\n1.6 to 2.4, because dissipationless LCDM halos have slightly different density\nprofiles and slightly radial velocity anisotropy. In N-body+gas simulations of\nEs as merger remnants of spirals embedded in DM halos, the slope of the DM\ndensity profile is steeper when the initial spiral galaxies are gas-rich. The\nHansen & Moore (2006) relation between anisotropy and the slope of the density\nprofile breaks down for gas and DM, but the stars follow an analogous relation\nwith slightly less radial anisotropies for a given density slope. Using\nkurtosis (h_4) to infer anisotropy in Es is dangerous, as h_4 is also sensitive\nto small levels of rotation. The stationary Jeans equation provides accurate\nmasses out to 8 Re. The discrepancy between the modeling of Romanowsky et al.\n(2003), indicating a dearth of DM in Es, and the simulations analyzed by Dekel\net al. (2005), which match the spectroscopic observations of Es, is partly due\nto radial anisotropy and to observing oblate Es face-on. However, one of the 15\nsolutions to the orbit modeling of Romanowsky et al. is found to have an amount\nand concentration of DM consistent with LCDM predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2006 20:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The sample of type-1 and type-2 AGN was selected at 15 micron\n(ISO) and 12 micron (IRAS), and classified on the basis of their optical\nspectra. Local templates of type-1 and type-2 AGN have been used to derive the\nintrinsic 15 micron luminosities. We adopted an evolving smooth two-power law\nshape of the LF, whose parameters have been derived using an un-binned maximum\nlikelihood method. We find that the LF of type-1 AGN is compatible with a pure\nluminosity evolution (L(z)=L(0)(1+z)^k_L) model where k_L~2.9. A small\nflattening of the faint slope of the LF with increasing redshift is favoured by\nthe data. A similar evolutionary scenario is found for the type-2 population\nwith a rate k_L ranging from ~1.8 to 2.6, depending significantly on the\nadopted mid-infrared spectral energy distribution. Also for type-2 AGN a\nflattening of the LF with increasing redshift is suggested by the data,\npossibly caused by the loss of a fraction of type-2 AGN hidden within the\noptically classified starburst and normal galaxies. The type-1 AGN contribution\nto the CIRB at 15 micron is (4.2-12.1) x 10e-11 W m^-2 sr^-1, while the type-2\nAGN contribution is (5.5-11.0) x 10e-11 W m^-2 sr^-1.

New methods have been suggested in order to avoid the drawbacks\nof the standard wide-field method (homothetic mapping) which is not applicable\nwhen the aperture is highly diluted; for this reason imaging with\nnon-homothetic arrays is being extensively studied [1], [2]. The field of view\nof a pupil plane interferometer or a densified array consists only of a few\nresolution elements; in order to improve these systems, we developed a new\nmethod consisting of a Michelson pupil-plane combination scheme where a wide\nfield of view can be achieved in one shot.

Experimental results have been obtained\nshowing the simultaneous recovering of the fringes of off-axis stars with an\nappreciable angular separation, and with a contrast similar to that of the\non-axis reference star. With this example, we demonstrate an increase of the\nfield of view by a factor of five, with no need of extra observation time. In\nthis article, we present a further analysis of the method. We investigate how\nto retrieve the visibility when a star is focused on the edge of a step of the\nstair-shaped mirror.

By implementing specific\ninterpolation methods to deal with these irregularly sampled data, we produced\nmaps of the polarized diffuse Galactic radio emission with pixel size of 0.92\ndeg.

We\nconsidered the whole covered region and some patches at different Galactic\nlatitudes. By fitting the APS in terms of power laws (C_l = k l^a), we found\nspectral indices that steepen with increasing frequency: from a = -(1-1.5) at\n408 MHz to a = -(2-3) at 1411 MHz for 10 < l < 100 and from a = -0.7 to a =\n-1.5 for lower multipoles (the exact values depending on the considered sky\nregion and polarization mode).

The limiting\nmoments of algebraic random matrix sequences, when they exist, are shown to\nsatisfy a finite depth linear recursion so that they may often be efficiently\nenumerated in closed form.\n  In this article, we develop the mathematics of the polynomial method which\nallows us to describe the class of algebraic matrices by its generators and map\nthe constructive approach we employ when proving algebraicity into a software\nimplementation that is available for download in the form of the RMTool random\nmatrix \"calculator\" package. Our characterization of the closure of algebraic\nprobability distributions under free additive and multiplicative convolution\noperations allows us to simultaneously establish a framework for computational\n(non-commutative) \"free probability\" theory. We hope that the tools developed\nallow researchers to finally harness the power of the infinite random matrix\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2006 18:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Sep 2007 16:56:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Oct 2007 19:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-10-31"}
