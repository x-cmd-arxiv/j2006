These coronae extend outwards until\neither the pressure of the hot coronal gas overcomes the magnetic field, or, if\nthe corona interacts with a disk before this happens, by the action of the disk\nitself. This work is motivated by the results of the Chandra Orion Ultradeep\nProject (COUP) that show an increase in the X-ray emission measure with\nincreasing stellar mass. We find that this variation (and its large scatter)\nresult naturally from the variation in the sizes of the stellar coronae. The\nreduction in the magnitude of the X-ray emission due to the presence of a disk\nstripping the outer parts of the stellar corona is most pronounced for the\nlower mass stars. The higher mass stars with their greater surface gravities\nhave coronae than typically do not extend out as far as the inner edge of the\ndisk and so are less affected by it. For these stars, accretion takes place\nalong open field lines that connect to the disk. By extrapolating surface\nmagnetograms of young main sequence stars we have examined the effect on the\nX-ray emission of a realistic degree of field complexity. We find densities\nconsistent with estimates from modelling of individual flares. A simple dipole\nfield in contrast gives densities typically an order of magnitude less. We\nsuggest that T Tauri stars have coronal fields that are slightly more extended\nthan their main sequence counterparts, but not as extended as a purely dipolar\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Jan 2006 16:00:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We find that all species affected by radiation force\nare heavily ionized and dynamically coupled into a single fluid by Coulomb\ncollisions, reducing the radiation force on species feeling the strongest\nacceleration. For a gas of solar composition, the resulting total radiation\nforce still exceeds gravity, while a gas of enhanced carbon abundance could be\nself-braking. We also explore two other braking agents: collisions with dust\ngrains and neutral gas. Grains surrounding beta Pic are photoelectrically\ncharged to a positive electrostatic potential. If a significant fraction of the\ngrains are carbonaceous (10% in the midplane and larger at higher altitudes),\nions can be slowed down to satisfy the observed velocity constraints. For\nneutral gas to brake the coupled ion fluid, we find the minimum required mass\nto be $\\approx$ 0.03 $M_\\earth$, consistent with observed upper limits of the\nhydrogen column density, and substantially reduced relative to previous\nestimates. Our results favor a scenario in which metallic gas is generated by\ngrain evaporation in the disk, perhaps during grain-grain collisions. We\nexclude a primordial origin for the gas, but cannot rule out the possibility of\nits production by falling evaporating bodies near the star. We discuss the\nimplications of this work for observations of gas in other debris disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2006 15:51:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A two state non-Markovian process with an arbitrary\nnon-exponential distribution of residence times (RTDs) in its states with a\nfinite mean residence time provides a paradigm. For the case of a two-state\nquantum relaxation caused by such a classical stochastic field we obtain the\nexplicit exact, analytical expression for the averaged Laplace-transformed\nrelaxation dynamics. In the limit of Markovian noise (implying an exponential\nRTD), all previously known results are recovered. We exemplify new more general\nresults for the case of non-Markovian noise with a biexponential RTD.

The goal is the development of an appropriate\nparametric down-conversion (PDC) source at telecom wavelengths meeting the\nrequirements of high-efficiency pair production and collection in single\nspectral and spatial modes (single-mode fibers). We propose a protocol to\noptimize the photon collection, noise levels and the uncertainty evaluation.\nThis study ties together the results of our efforts to model the single-mode\nheralding efficiency of a two-photon PDC source and to estimate the heralding\nuncertainty of such a source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2006 09:17:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Jan 2006 11:22:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Alice\nproduces coherent 20 ns faint pulses of light at 853 nm. They are sent to Bob\nwith delay 0 ns (encoding bit 0) or 10 ns (encoding bit 1). Bob directs at\nrandom the received pulses to two different arms. In the first one, a 300 ps\nresolution Si photon-counter allows Bob to precisely measure the detection\ntimes of each photon in order to establish the key. Comparing them with the\nemission times of the pulses sent by Alice allows to evaluate the quantum bit\nerror rate (QBER). The minimum obtained QBER is 1.62 %. The possible loss of\ncoherence in the set-up can be exploited by Eve to eavesdrop the line.\nTherefore, the second arm of Bob set-up is a Mach-Zender interferometer with a\n10 ns propagation delay between the two path. Contrast measurement of the\noutput beams allows to measure the autocorrelation function of the received\npulses that characterizes their average coherence. In the case of an ideal\nset-up, the value expected with the pulses sent by Alice is 0.576. The\nexperimental value of the pulses autocorrelation function is found to be 0.541.\nKnowing the resulting loss of coherence and the measured QBER, one can evaluate\nthe mutual information between Alice and Eve and the mutual information between\nAlice and Bob, in the case of intercept-resend attacks and in the case of\nattacks with intrication. With our values, Bob has an advantage on Eve of 0.43\nbit per pulse. The maximum possible QBER corresponding to equal informations\nfor Bob and Eve is 5.8 %. With the usual attenuation of fibres at 850 nm, it\nshows that secure key distribution is possible up to a distance of 2.75 km,\nwhich is sufficient for local links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Jan 2006 09:18:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
