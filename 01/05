For isolated galaxy\nmodels we have performed a convergence study and estimated the numerical\nparameters ranges for which the relaxed models do not deviate significantly\nfrom its initial configuration. By fixing N, we calculate the range of the mean\ninterparticle separation $\\lambda(r)$ along the disc radius. We have found that\nin the simulations with N=1310720 particles $\\lambda$ varies by a factor of 6,\nand the corresponding final Toomre's parameters Q change by only about 5 per\ncent. By decreasing N, the $\\lambda$ and Q ranges broaden. Large $\\epsilon$ and\nsmall N cause an earlier bar formation. For a given set of parameters the disc\nheating is smaller with the Plummer softening than with the spline softening.\nFor galaxy collision models numerical simulations indicate that the properties\nof the formed bars strongly depend upon the selection of N and $\\epsilon$.\nLarge values of the gravitational softening parameter and a small number of\nparticles results in the rapid formation of a well defined, slowly rotating\nbar. On the other hand, small values of $\\epsilon$ produce a small, rapidly\nrotating disc with tightly wound spiral arms, and subsequently a weak bar\nemerges. We have found that by increasing N, the bar properties converge and\nthe effect of the softening parameter diminishes. Finally, in some cases short\nspiral arms are observed at the ends of the bar that change periodically from\ntrailing to leading and vice-versa - the wiggle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Jan 2006 17:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-10-13"}

Here we calculate the\nheating rates required to maintain a physically motived mass flow rate, in a\nsample of seven galaxy clusters. We employ the spectroscopic mass deposition\nrates as an observational input along with temperature and density data for\neach cluster. On energetic grounds we find that thermal conduction could\nprovide the necessary heating for A2199, Perseus, A1795 and A478. However, the\nsuppression factor, of the clasical Spitzer value, is a different function of\nradius for each cluster. Based on the observations of plasma bubbles we also\ncalculate the duty cycles for each AGN, in the absence of thermal conduction,\nwhich can provide the required energy input. With the exception of Hydra-A it\nappears that each of the other AGNs in our sample require duty cycles of\nroughly $10^{6}-10^{7}$ yrs to provide their steady-state heating requirements.\nIf these duty cycles are unrealistic, this may imply that many galaxy clusters\nmust be heated by very powerful Hydra-A type events interspersed between more\nfrequent smaller-scale outbursts. The suppression factors for the thermal\nconductivity required for combined heating by AGN and thermal conduction are\ngenerally acceptable. However, these suppression factors still require\n`fine-tuning` of the thermal conductivity as a function of radius. As a\nconsequence of this work we present the AGN duty cycle as a cooling flow\ndiagnostic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2006 12:49:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The simulation is\nfocused on the Steady-State Analysis. The Intermediate Heat exchangers (IHX) of\nthe X-ADS reference configuration are immersed in the lead-bismuth eutectic of\nthe downcomer. Due to the absence of a physical separation between the primary\ncoolant hot and cold collectors, two different flow paths are available in the\ndowncomer region: inside the IHX and outside it (IHX by-pass flow). The amount\nof IHX by-pass flow is determined by the balance between the driving force due\nto buoyancy (originated by the weight difference between the cooled fluid\ninside the IHX and the hot outside downcomer fluid) and the IHX pressure\nlosses. At the IHX exit the two flow paths are mixed before the core inlet.\nThis fact provides a potential for a downcomer thermal stratification, which is\ninfluenced by the actual value of coolant flow rate outside the IHX. The amount\nand extension of the thermal stratification phenomena is the object of this\nstudy. The simulation allowed studying the position and intensity of the\nthermal stratification phenomena.
