Large,\nblind QSO surveys for low redshift DLAs are therefore an expensive prospect for\nspace-borne UV telescopes. Increasing the efficiency of these surveys by\npre-selecting DLA candidates based on the equivalent widths of metal absorption\nlines has previously been a successful strategy. However, the success rate of\nDLA identification is still only ~ 35% when simple equivalent width cut-offs\nare applied, the majority of systems having 19.0 < log N(HI)<20.3.

Our technique requires\nhigh-to-moderate resolution spectroscopy of the MgII 2796 transition, which is\neasily accessible from the ground for 0.2 < z < 2.4. We define the D-index, the\nratio of the line's equivalent width to velocity spread and measure this\nquantity for 19 DLAs and 8 sub-DLAs in archival spectra obtained with echelle\nspectrographs. For the majority of absorbers, there is a clear distinction\nbetween the D-index of DLAs compared with sub-DLAs (Kolmogorov-Smirnov\nprobability = 0.8%). Based on this pilot data sample, we find that the D-index\ncan select DLAs with a success rate of up to 90%, an increase in selection\nefficiency by a factor of 2.5 compared with a simple equivalent width cut. We\ntest the applicability of the D-index at lower resolution and find that it\nremains a good discriminant of DLAs for FWHM < 1.5 A. However, the recommended\nD-index cut-off between DLAs and sub-DLAs decreases with poorer resolution and\nwe tabulate the appropriate D-index values that should be used with spectra of\ndifferent resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Jan 2006 21:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Nevertheless, the model acts as a dynamical dark-energy model since\nthe scaling of $G_{N}$ goes at the expense of deviation of concentration of\ndark-matter particles from its canonical form and/or of promotion of their mass\nto a time-dependent quantity, thereby making the effective equation of state\n(EOS) variable and different from -1 at the present epoch. Thus the model has a\npotential to naturally underpin Dirac's suggestion for explaining the\nlarge-number hypothesis, which demands a dynamical $G_{N}$ along with the\ncreation of matter in the universe.

Other\nfields such as reliable computation offer combinations of models and associated\nmethods to handle these types of uncertain data, but lack an expressive\nframework characterising the resolution methodology independently of the model.\n  We present a unifying framework that extends the CP formalism in both model\nand solutions, to tackle ill-defined combinatorial problems with incomplete or\nerroneous data.

By taking color-octet components into account, the\napproach can explain the $\\psi'$-anomaly at Tevatron, where the measured\nproduction rate at large transverse momentum $p_\\perp$ is in order of magnitude\nlarger than the predicted with color-singlet components only. With the approach\none can predict that the produced $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi'$ at large $p_\\perp$ will\nbe transversely polarized. But the prediction fails in confronting with\nexperimental measurements and this generates a puzzle. We examine the role of\nspin-flip interactions in the spin density matrix of the transition of a\ncolor-octet charm quark pair into $J/\\psi$ and $\\psi'$. These interactions will\nintroduce new nonperturbative parameters in the spin density matrix. Our result\nshows that the impact of the interactions is always to dilute the polarization\nand can be very significant. Taking the impact into account, predictions for\nthe polarization are more close to the measured than the previous predicted.\nThe same can also be expected for the polarization of $J/\\psi$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2006 06:27:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Jul 2006 07:41:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 2007 02:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The simulations and\ntheoretical analysis have been done without and with the handles that are\nexplicitly modeled by semiflexible polymer chains. The mechanisms and time\nscales for denaturation by temperature jump and mechanical unfolding are vastly\ndifferent. The directed perturbation of the native state by $f_S$ results in a\nsequential unfolding of the hairpin starting from their ends whereas thermal\ndenaturation occurs stochastically. From the dependence of the unfolding rates\non $r_f$ and $f_S$ we show that the position of the unfolding transition state\n(TS) is not a constant but moves dramatically as either $r_f$ or $f_S$ is\nchanged. The TS movements are interpreted by adopting the Hammond postulate for\nforced-unfolding. Forced-unfolding simulations of RNA, with handles attached to\nthe two ends, show that the value of the unfolding force increases (especially\nat high pulling speeds) as the length of the handles increases. The pathways\nfor refolding of RNA from stretched initial conformation, upon quenching $f_S$\nto the quench force $f_Q$, are highly heterogeneous. The refolding times, upon\nforce quench, are at least an order of magnitude greater than those obtained by\ntemperature quench. The long $f_Q$-dependent refolding times starting from\nfully stretched states are analyzed using a model that accounts for the\nmicroscopic steps in the rate limiting step which involves the trans to gauche\ntransitions of the dihedral angles in the GAAA tetraloop. The simulations with\nexplicit molecular model for the handles show that the dynamics of force-quench\nrefolding is strongly dependent on the interplay of their contour length and\nthe persistence length, and the RNA persistence length.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Jan 2006 04:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2006 23:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
