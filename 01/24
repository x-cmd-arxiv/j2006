Are quasars located in environments similar to those\nof typical L* galaxies, and, if not, how do they differ? An answer to this\nquestion will help shed light on the triggering process of quasar activity. We\nuse the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study the environment of quasars and\ncompare it directly with the environment of galaxies. We find that quasars (M_i\n< -22, z < 0.4) are located in higher local overdensity regions than are\ntypical L* galaxies. The enhanced environment around quasars is a local\nphenomenon; the overdensity relative to that around L* galaxies is strongest\nwithin 100 kpc of the quasars. In this region, the overdensity is a factor of\n1.4 larger than around L* galaxies. The overdensity declines monotonically with\nscale to nearly unity at ~1 Mpc, where quasars inhabit environments comparable\nto those of L* galaxies. The small-scale density enhancement depends on quasar\nluminosity, but only at the brightest end: the most luminous quasars reside in\nhigher local overdensity regions than do fainter quasars. The mean overdensity\naround the brightest quasars (M_i < -23.3) is nearly three times larger than\naround L* galaxies while the density around dimmer quasars (M_i = -22.0 to\n-23.3) is ~1.4 times that of L* galaxies. By ~0.5 Mpc, the dependence on quasar\nluminosity is no longer significant. The overdensity on all scales is\nindependent of redshift to z = 0.4. The results suggest a picture in which\nquasars typically reside in L* galaxies, but have a local excess of neighbors\nwithin ~0.1 - 0.5 Mpc; this local density excess likely contributes to the\ntriggering of quasar activity through mergers and other interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2006 21:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We clearly see that\nimage D is a point-source image of the quasar at the center of its host galaxy.\nWe can easily track the host galaxy of the quasar close to image D because\nmicrolensing has provided a natural coronograph that suppresses the flux of the\nquasar image by roughly an order of magnitude. We observe low amplitude,\nuncorrelated variability between the four quasar images due to microlensing,\nbut no correlated variations that could be used to measure a time delay. Monte\nCarlo models of the microlensing variability provide estimates of the mean\nstellar mass in the lens galaxy (0.02 Msun < M < 1.0 Msun), the accretion disk\nsize (the disk temperature is 5 x 10^4 K at 3.0 x 10^14 cm < rs < 1.4 x 10^15\ncm), and the black hole mass (2.0 x 10^7 Msun < MBH \\eta_{0.1}^{-1/2}\n(L/LE)^{1/2} < 3.3 x 10^8 Msun), all at 68% confidence. The black hole mass\nestimate based on microlensing is consistent with an estimate of MBH = 7.3 +-\n2.4 x 10^7 Msun from the MgII emission line width. If we extrapolate the\nbest-fitting light curve models into the future, we expect the the flux of\nimages A and B to remain relatively stable and images C and D to brighten. In\nparticular, we estimate that image D has a roughly 12% probability of\nbrightening by a factor of two during the next year and a 45% probability of\nbrightening by an order of magnitude over the next decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Jan 2006 21:11:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Jul 2007 14:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-02-11"}

Albert, Jeong and Barabasi famously analysed the static\ncase, and showed that vertex-order attacks are effective against scale-free\nnetworks. We extend this work to the dynamic case by developing a framework\nbased on evolutionary game theory to explore the interaction of attack and\ndefence strategies. We show, first, that naive defences don't work against\nvertex-order attack; second, that defences based on simple redundancy don't\nwork much better, but that defences based on cliques work well; third, that\nattacks based on centrality work better against clique defences than\nvertex-order attacks do; and fourth, that defences based on complex strategies\nsuch as delegation plus clique resist centrality attacks better than simple\nclique defences. Our models thus build a bridge between network analysis and\nevolutionary game theory, and provide a framework for analysing defence and\nattack in networks where topology matters. They suggest definitions of\nefficiency of attack and defence, and may even explain the evolution of\ninsurgent organisations from networks of cells to a more virtual leadership\nthat facilitates operations rather than directing them.

It is shown, on the basis of several examples\nrelated to the pion, as a well-known Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry\nbreaking, that even the non-unitarized QLL$\\sigma$M approach accounts, to a\ngood approximation, for a rather simple, self-consistent, linear, and very\npredictive description of Nature. On the other hand, ChPT -- even when\nunitarized -- provides a highly distorted, nonlinear, hardly predictive picture\nof Nature, which fits experiment only at the price of a lot of parameters, and\nrequires a great deal of unnecessary theoretical effort. As the origin of this\ndistortion, we identify the fact that ChPT, reflecting only direct ChSB by\nnonvanishing, current-quark-mass values, does not -- contrary to Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD) and the QLL$\\sigma$M -- contain any mechanism for the\nspontaneous generation of the dynamical component of the constituent quark\nmass. This leads to a very peculiar picture of Nature, since the strange\ncurrent quark mass has to compensate for the absence of nonstrange dynamical\nquark masses. We thus conclude that standard ChPT -- contrary to common wisdom\n-- is unlikely to be the low-energy limit of QCD. On the contrary, a chiral\nperturbation theory derived from the QLL$\\sigma$M, presumably being the true\nlow-energy limit of QCD, is expected instead to provide a distortion-free\ndescription of Nature, which is based on the heavy standard-model Higgs boson\nas well as light scalar mesons, as the source of spontaneous generation of\ncurrent and dynamical quark masses, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Jan 2006 11:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This theory agrees well with experiments for long molecules. Recent\nsingle-molecule experiments have used shorter molecules, with contour lengths\nin the range of 1-10 persistence lengths. Most WLC theory calculations to date\nhave assumed infinite molecule lengths, and do not agree well with experiments\non shorter chains. Key physical effects that become important when shorter\nmolecules are used include (i) boundary conditions which constrain the allowed\nfluctuations at the ends of the molecule and (ii) rotational fluctuations of\nthe bead to which the polymer is attached, which change the apparent extension\nof the molecule. We describe the finite worm-like chain (FWLC) theory, which\ntakes into account these effects.
