Single guide star systems with a star\ncreated in the earth's sodium layer can be used to correct the wavefront in the\nnear infrared spectral regime for 8-m class telescopes. For possible future\ntelescopes of larger sizes, or for correction at shorter wavelengths, the use\nof a single guide star is ultimately limited by focal anisoplanatism that\narises from the finite height of the guide star. To overcome this limitation we\npropose to overlap coherently pulsed laser beams that are expanded over the\nfull aperture of the telescope, traveling upwards along the same path which\nlight from the astronomical object travels downwards. Imaging the scattered\nlight from the resultant interference pattern with a camera gated to a certain\nheight above the telescope, and using phase shifting interferometry we have\nfound a method to retrieve the local wavefront gradients. By sensing the\nbackscattered light from two different heights, one can fully remove the cone\neffect, which can otherwise be a serious handicap to the use of laser guide\nstars at shorter wavelengths or on larger telescopes. Using two laser beams\nmulticonjugate correction is possible, resulting in larger corrected fields.\nWith a proper choice of laser, wavefront correction could be expanded to the\nvisible regime and, due to the lack of a cone effect, the method is applicable\nto any size of telescope. Finally the position of the laser spot could be\nimaged from the side of the main telescope against a bright background star to\nretrieve tip-tilt information, which would greatly improve the sky coverage of\nthe system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Jan 2006 21:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In order to construct these diagrams, we\nprove theorems characterizing when the numerator of the sum of two rational\ntangles is an unknot. The key theorem shows that the numerator of the sum of\ntwo rational tangles [P/Q] and [R/S] is unknotted if and only if PS + QR has\nabsolute value equal to 1. The paper uses these results in studying processive\nDNA recombination, finding minimal size unknot diagrams, generalizing to\ncollapses to knots as well as to unknots, and in finding unknots with\narbirarily high complexity. The paper is self-contained, with a review of the\ntheory of rational tangles and a last section on relationships of the theme of\nthe paper with other aspects of topology and number theory. The present version\nof the paper contains a correction to Figure 22 of the previous (and published)\nversion, a small expansion to the section on Farey fractions, and an updated\nreference to the paper \"Unknotting unknots\" by Henrich and Kauffman.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2006 04:32:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2006 04:38:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2006 07:07:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 15 Mar 2006 06:25:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 26 Jul 2014 06:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-07-29"}
