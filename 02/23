At\nthe orbit of Saturn, the bulk chemical constituents of the condensate are rock\n(mass fraction 0.494), water ice (0.474), and graphite (0.032). The mean\ndensity is 1523 kg/m^3.

Pauli spin\nsusceptibility is observed to grow critically at low electron densities -\nbehavior that is characteristic of the existence of a phase transition. A new,\nparameter-free method is used to directly determine the spectrum\ncharacteristics (Lande g-factor and the cyclotron mass) when the Fermi level\nlies outside the spectral gaps and the inter-level interactions between\nquasiparticles are avoided. It turns out that, unlike in the Stoner scenario,\nthe critical growth of the spin susceptibility originates from the dramatic\nenhancement of the effective mass, while the enhancement of the g-factor is\nweak and practically independent of the electron density.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2006 18:46:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Apr 2006 16:04:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jun 2006 14:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Casimir's conducting plates are modelized by plasmas\nof interacting charges at temperature T. The charges are either classical, or\nquantum-mechanical and coupled to a (classical) radiation field. In these\nmodels, the force obtained is twice weaker than that arising from standard\ntreatments neglecting the microscopic charge fluctutations inside the bodies.\nThe enforcement of inert boundary conditions on the field in the usual\ncalculations turns out to be inadequate in this regime.\n  Other aspects of dispersion forces are also reviewed. The status of\n(non-retarded) van der Waals-London forces in a dilute medium of non-zero\ntemperature and density is investigated. In a proper scaling regime called the\natomic limit (high dilution and low temperature), one is able to give the exact\nlarge-distance atomic correlations up to exponentially small terms as T->0.\n  Retarded van der Waals forces and forces between dielectric bodies are also\nreviewed.\n  Finally, the Casimir effect in critical phenomena is addressed by considering\nthe free Bose gas. It is shown that the grand-canonical potential of the gas in\na slab at the critical value of the chemical potential has finite size\ncorrections of the standard Casimir type.

We model a\ntwo-allele competition where recurrent mutation introduces a genotype with a\nrate of local propagation exceeding the resident's rate. We capture\necologically important properties of the rare invader's stochastic dynamics by\nassuming discrete individuals and neighborhood interactions. To understand how\nindividual-level processes may govern population patterns, we invoke the\nphysical theory for nucleation of spatial systems. Nucleation theory\ndiscriminates between single-cluster and multi-cluster dynamics. A sufficiently\nlow mutation rate, or a sufficiently small environment, generates\nsingle-cluster dynamics, an inherently stochastic process; a favorable mutation\nadvances only if the invader cluster reaches a critical radius. For this mode\nof invasion we identify the probability distribution of waiting times until the\nfavored allele advances to competitive dominance, and we ask how the critical\ncluster size varies as propagation or mortality rates vary. Increasing the\nmutation rate or system size generates multi-cluster invasion, where spatial\naveraging produces nearly deterministic global dynamics. For this process, an\nanalytical approximation from nucleation theory, called Avrami's Law, describes\nthe time-dependent behavior of the genotype densities with remarkable accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2006 22:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
