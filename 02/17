We reconstruct the microscopic dynamics of particles from the \"coarse\ngrained\" dynamics of spots by introducing a localized particle relaxation step\nafter each spot-induced block displacement, simply to enforce packing\nconstraints with a (fairly arbitrary) soft-core repulsion. To test the model,\nwe study to what extent it can describe the dynamics of up to 135,000\nfrictional, viscoelastic spheres in granular drainage simulated by the\ndiscrete-element method (DEM). With only five fitting parameters (the radius,\nvolume, diffusivity, drift velocity, and injection rate of spots), we find that\nthe spot simulations are able to largely reproduce not only the mean flow and\ndiffusion, but also some subtle statistics of the flowing packings, such as\nspatial velocity correlations and many-body structural correlations.

Within this context, a good solution for the gauge\nhierarchy problem corresponds to low masses for the Kaluza-Klein (KK)\nexcitations of the gauge bosons.

One of the requirements is the\nimplementation of decays into five mesons plus a neutrino with a realistic\ndecay amplitude. This note describes a step into this direction. For the 2pi-\npi+ 2pi0 mode the three decay chains tau- --> a_1- nu --> rho- (--> pi- pi0)\nomega (--> pi- pi+ pi0) nu, tau- --> a_1- nu --> a_1- (--> 2pi- pi+) f_0 (-->\n2pi0) nu, and tau- --> a_1- nu --> a_1- (--> pi- 2pi0) f_0 (--> pi + pi-) nu\nare introduced with simple assumptions about the couplings and propagators of\nthe various resonances. Similar amplitudes (without the rho omega\ncontributions) are adopted for the pi- 4pi0 and 3pi- 2pi+ modes.\n  The five-pion amplitude is thus based on a simple model, which, however, can\nbe considered as a first realistic example. Phase-space generation includes the\npossibility of presampling the omega and a_1 resonances, in one channel only,\nhowever. This is probably sufficient for the time being, both for physics\napplications and for tests.\n  The technical test of the new part of the generator is performed by comparing\nMonte Carlo and analytical results.

Moduli spaces of domain walls (kinks) and vortices,\nwhich are the only elementary solitons in the Higgs phase, are found in terms\nof the moduli matrix. Stable monopoles and instantons can exist in the Higgs\nphase if they are attached by vortices to form composite solitons. The moduli\nspaces of these composite solitons are also worked out in terms of the moduli\nmatrix. Webs of walls can also be formed with characteristic difference between\nAbelian and non-Abelian gauge theories. We characterize the total moduli space\nof these elementary as well as composite solitons. Effective Lagrangians are\nconstructed on walls and vortices in a compact form.

The proposal is developed as follows using the\nconfidence measure of a scalar parameter of interest. (With the restriction to\none-dimensional parameter space, a confidence measure is essentially a fiducial\nprobability distribution free of complications involving ancillary statistics.)\n  A betting game establishes a sense in which confidence measures are the only\nreliable inferential probability distributions. The equality between the\nprobabilities encoded in a confidence measure and the coverage rates of the\ncorresponding confidence intervals ensures that the measure's rule for\nassigning confidence levels to hypotheses is uniquely minimax in the game.\n  Although a confidence measure can be computed without any prior distribution,\nprevious knowledge can be incorporated into confidence-based reasoning. To\nadjust a p-value or confidence interval for prior information, the confidence\nmeasure from the observed data can be combined with one or more independent\nconfidence measures representing previous agent opinion. (The former confidence\nmeasure may correspond to a posterior distribution with frequentist matching of\ncoverage probabilities.) The representation of subjective knowledge in terms of\nconfidence measures rather than prior probability distributions preserves\napproximate frequentist validity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2006 15:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Sep 2006 21:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2009 17:23:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-03-01"}
