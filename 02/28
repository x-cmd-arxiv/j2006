By using a combination of classical with ab initio\nquantum mechanical methods, we design on the computer reliable modified\nstructures of CuCCP aimed at studying effects of Cu-Cu coupling strength\nvariations on this spin-1/2 system. For this purpose, we performed two types of\nmodifications on CuCCP. In one case, we replaced H in the linker by i) an\nelectron donating group (NH2) and ii) an electron withdrawing group (CN), while\nthe other modification consisted in adding H2O and NH3 molecules in the\nstructure which change the local coordination of the Cu(II) ions. With the\nNMTO-downfolding method we provide a quantitative analysis of the modified\nelectronic structure and the nature of the Cu-Cu interaction paths in these new\nstructures and discuss its implications for the underlying microscopic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 16:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jun 2006 11:39:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 2007 11:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Two different\nequations are studied: the TAP equations which are exact for the SK model, and\nthe simpler `naive-mean-field' (NMF) equations. The free-energy landscapes that\nemerge are very different. For the TAP equations, the numerical studies confirm\nthe analytical results of Aspelmeier et al., which predict that TAP states\nconsist of close pairs of minima and index-one (one unstable direction) saddle\npoints, while for the NMF equations saddle points with large indices are found.\nFor TAP the barrier height between a minimum and its nearby saddle point scales\nas (f-f_0)^{-1/3} where f is the free energy per spin of the solution and f_0\nis the equilibrium free energy per spin. This means that for `pure states', for\nwhich f-f_0 is of order 1/N, the barriers scale as N^{1/3}, but between states\nfor which f-f_0 is of order one the barriers are finite and also small so such\nmetastable states will be of limited physical significance. For the NMF\nequations there are saddles of index K and we can demonstrate that their\ncomplexity Sigma_K scales as a function of K/N. We have also employed an\niterative scheme with a free parameter that can be adjusted to bring the system\nof equations close to the `edge of chaos'. Both for the TAP and NME equations\nit is possible with this approach to find metastable states whose free energy\nper spin is close to f_0. As N increases, it becomes harder and harder to find\nsolutions near the edge of chaos, but nevertheless the results which can be\nobtained are competitive with those achieved by more time-consuming computing\nmethods and suggest that this method may be of general utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 19:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Although\nthis study has several important limitations, we find a number of intriguing\nfeatures which may be relevant for the heterotic landscape as a whole. These\nfeatures include different probabilities and correlations for different\npossible gauge groups as functions of the number of orbifold twists. We also\nfind a vast degeneracy amongst non-supersymmetric string models, leading to a\nsevere reduction in the number of realizable values of the cosmological\nconstant as compared with naive expectations. Finally, we also find strong\ncorrelations between cosmological constants and gauge groups which suggest that\nheterotic string models with extremely small cosmological constants are\noverwhelmingly more likely to exhibit the Standard-Model gauge group at the\nstring scale than any of its grand-unified extensions.

It is shown in this note that a simple manipulation of the\nHedden-Ording examples yields a topologically slice Alexander polynomial one\nknot for which tau and s differ. Manolescu and Owens have previously found a\nconcordance invariant that is independent of both tau and s on knots of\npolynomial one, and as a consequence have shown that the smooth concordance\ngroup of topologically slice knots contains a summand isomorphic to a free\nabelian group on two generators. It thus follows quickly from the observation\nin this note that this concordance group contains a subgroup isomorphic to a\nfree abelian group on three generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 21:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Mar 2006 18:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-10-18"}

Using Monte Carlo simulations and a\nsimple mean-field theory, we discuss the effect of one or two ``bottlenecks''\n(i.e., slow codons) on the production rate of the final protein. Confirming and\nextending previous work by Chou and Lakatos, we find that the location and\nspacing of the slow codons can affect the production rate quite dramatically.\nIn particular, we observe a novel ``edge'' effect, i.e., an interaction of a\nsingle slow codon with the system boundary. We focus in detail on ribosome\ndensity profiles and provide a simple explanation for the length scale which\ncontrols the range of these interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 19:16:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2006 16:09:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jun 2006 15:59:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-08-02"}

Although the neural responses to both\nAM and FM sounds are extensively studied in both animals and humans, it is\nuncertain how they are co-represented when changed simultaneously but\nindependently, as is typical for ecologically natural signals. This study\nelucidates the neural coding of such sounds in human auditory cortex using\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG). Using stimuli with both sinusoidal modulated\nenvelope (f_{AM}, 37 Hz) and carrier frequency (f_{FM}, 0.3 - 8 Hz), it is\ndemonstrated that AM and FM stimulus dynamics are co-represented in the neural\ncode of human auditory cortex. The stimulus AM dynamics are represented\nneurally with AM encoding, by the auditory Steady State Response (aSSR) at\nf_{AM}. For sounds with slowly changing carrier frequency ((f_{FM} < 5 Hz), it\nis shown that the stimulus FM dynamics are tracked by the phase of the aSSR,\ndemonstrating neural phase modulation (PM) encoding of the stimulus carrier\nfrequency. For sounds with faster carrier frequency change ((f_{FM} >= 5 Hz),\nit is shown that modulation encoding of stimulus FM dynamics persists, but the\nneural encoding is no longer purely PM. This result is consistent with the\nrecruitment of additional neural AM encoding over and above the original neural\nPM encoding, indicating that both the amplitude and phase of the aSSR at f_{AM}\ntrack the stimulus FM dynamics. A neural model is suggested to account for\nthese observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 21:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

All this serves to motivate a classical\nalgorithm which, given the expected values of a subset of an orthogonal basis\nof observables of an otherwise unknown quantum state, searches for an\nentanglement witness in the span of the subset of observables. The idea of such\nan algorithm, which is an efficient reduction of the quantum separability\nproblem to a global optimization problem, was introduced in PRA 70 060303(R),\nwhere it was shown to be an improvement on the naive approach for the quantum\nseparability problem (exhaustive search for a decomposition of the given state\ninto a convex combination of separable states).
