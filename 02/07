The alpha- and gamma-effects, which are responsible for the generation\nand turbulent pumping of large scale magnetic fields, respectively, due to\npassive advection by convection are determined in the rapid rotation regime\ncorresponding to the deep layers of the solar convection zone.\n  Methods. A 3D rectangular local model is used for solving the full set of MHD\nequations in order to compute the electromotive force (emf), E = <u x b>,\ngenerated by the interaction of imposed weak gradient-free magnetic fields and\nturbulent convection with varying rotational influence and latitude. By\nexpanding the emf in terms of the mean magnetic field, E_i = a_ij <B_j>, all\nnine components of a_ij are computed. The diagonal elements of a_ij describe\nthe alpha-effect, whereas the off-diagonals represent magnetic pumping. The\nlatter is essentially the advection of magnetic fields by means other than the\nunderlying large-scale velocity field. Comparisons are made to analytical\nexpressions of the coefficients derived under the first-order smoothing\napproximation (FOSA).\n  Results. In the rapid rotation regime the latitudinal dependence of the\nalpha-components responsible for the generation of the azimuthal and radial\nfields does not exhibit a peak at the poles, as is the case for slow rotation,\nbut at a latitude of about 30 degrees. The magnetic pumping is predominantly\nradially down- and latitudinally equatorward as in earlier studies.

The dominant crystallization by thermal annealing happens in the very\nearly phases of disk formation and evolution. Both the disk properties and the\nlevel of crystallinity are thereby directly linked to the properties of the\nmolecular cloud core from which the star+disk system was formed. We show that,\nunder the assumption of single star formation, rapidly rotating clouds produce\ndisks which, after the main infall phase (i.e. in the optically revealed class\nII phase), are rather massive and have a high accretion rate but low\ncrystallinity. Slowly rotating clouds, on the other hand, produce less massive\ndisks with lower accretion rate, but high levels of crystallinity. Cloud\nfragmentation and the formation of multiple stars complicates the problem and\nnecessitates further study. The underlying physics of the model is\ninsufficiently understood to provide the precise relationship between\ncrystallinity, disk mass and accretion rate. But the fact that with `standard'\ninput physics the model produces disks which, in comparison to observations,\nappear to have either too high levels of crystallinity or too high disk masses,\ndemonstrates that the comparison of these models to observations can place\nstrong contraints on the disk physics.

Based on the\nutility definition for cooperative users, we show that the channel allocation\nproblem can be formulated as a potential game, and thus converges to a\ndeterministic channel allocation Nash equilibrium point. Alternatively, a\nno-regret learning implementation is proposed for both scenarios and it is\nshown to have similar performance with the potential game when cooperation is\nenforced, but with a higher variability across users. The no-regret learning\nformulation is particularly useful to accommodate selfish users.\nNon-cooperative learning games have the advantage of a very low overhead for\ninformation exchange in the network.\n  We show that cooperation based spectrum sharing etiquette improves the\noverall network performance at the expense of an increased overhead required\nfor information exchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2006 00:25:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This paper introduces a new class\nof interleavers, the inter-block permutation (IBP) interleavers, that can be\nbuild on any existing \"good\" block-wise interleaver by simply adding an IBP\nstage. The IBP interleavers reduce the above-mentioned correlation and increase\nthe effective interleaving size. The increased effective interleaving size\nimproves the distance spectrum while the reduced covariance enhances the\niterative decoder's performance. Moreover, the structure of the\nIBP(-interleaved) turbo codes (IBPTC) is naturally fit for high rate\napplications that necessitate parallel decoding.\n  We present some useful bounds and constraints associated with the IBPTC that\ncan be used as design guidelines. The corresponding codeword weight upper\nbounds for weight-2 and weight-4 input sequences are derived. Based on some of\nthe design guidelines, we propose a simple IBP algorithm and show that the\nassociated IBPTC yields 0.3 to 1.2 dB performance gain, or equivalently, an\nIBPTC renders the same performance with a much reduced interleaving delay.

On the\nother hand, canonicity of modal formulae is important, too, because it implies\nframe-completeness of logics axiomatized with canonical formulae.\n  Computing a first-order equivalent of a modal formula amounts to elimination\nof second-order quantifiers. Two algorithms have been developed for\nsecond-order quantifier elimination: SCAN, based on constraint resolution, and\nDLS, based on a logical equivalence established by Ackermann.\n  In this paper we introduce a new algorithm, SQEMA, for computing first-order\nequivalents (using a modal version of Ackermann's lemma) and, moreover, for\nproving canonicity of modal formulae. Unlike SCAN and DLS, it works directly on\nmodal formulae, thus avoiding Skolemization and the subsequent problem of\nunskolemization. We present the core algorithm and illustrate it with some\nexamples. We then prove its correctness and the canonicity of all formulae on\nwhich the algorithm succeeds.

There is an indication that this high gain\nis achieved through the Penning effect as a result of impurities in the gas. At\nlower temperatures the gain-voltage characteristics are significantly modified\nprobably due to the freeze-out of these impurities. Double-GEM and single-GEM\nstructures can operate down to 3 K at gains reaching only several tens at a gas\ndensity of about 0.5 g/l; at higher densities the maximum gain drops further.\nIn Ne, the maximum gain also drops at cryogenic temperatures. The gain drop in\nNe at low temperatures can be re-established in Penning mixtures of Ne+H2: very\nhigh gains, exceeding 104, have been obtained in these mixtures at 30-77 K, at\na density of 9.2 g/l which corresponds to saturated Ne vapor density at 27 K.\nThe addition of small amounts of H2 in He also re-establishes large GEM gains\nabove 30 K but no gain was observed in He+H2 at 4 K and a density of 1.7 g/l\n(corresponding to roughly one-tenth of the saturated vapor density).
