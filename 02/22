In this work we study numerically the interaction of electron and\nnuclear spins in the context of storing the spin-state of an electron in a\ncollective state of nuclear spins. We take into account the errors inherent in\na realistic system: the incomplete polarization of the bath of nuclear spins\nand the different hyperfine interactions between the electron and individual\nnuclei in the quantum dot. Although these imperfections deteriorate the\nfidelity of the quantum information retrieval, we find reasonable fidelities\nare achievable for modest bath polarizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2006 18:48:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Closest-point\nsearches in lattices can be performed as non-binary belief propagation on\nassociated TGs; soft-information output is naturally generated in the process;\nthe algorithm requires no backtrack (cf. classic sphere decoding), and extracts\nextrinsic information. A lattice's coding gain enables equivalence relations\nbetween lattice points, which can be thereby partitioned in cosets. Total and\nextrinsic a posteriori probabilities at the detector's output further enable\nthe use of soft detection information in iterative schemes. The algorithm is\nillustrated via two scenarios that transmit a 32-point, uncoded\nsuper-orthogonal (SO) constellation for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)\nchannels, carved from an 8-dimensional non-orthogonal lattice (a direct sum of\ntwo 4-dimensional checkerboard lattice): it achieves maximum likelihood\nperformance in quasistatic fading; and, performs close to interference-free\ntransmission, and identically to list sphere decoding, in independent fading\nwith coordinate interleaving and iterative equalization and detection.

The theory on open manifolds leads to a new nonperturbative\napproach to the infinities of QED. This idea exploits that the quantum Hilbert\nspace decomposes into subspaces (Zeeman zones) which are invariant under the\nactions both of this Zeeman-Laplace operator and the natural complex Heisenberg\ngroup representation. Thus a well defined particle theory and zonal geometry\ncan be developed on each zone separately.

In van Hove's limit, the dynamics\nis described in terms of a master equation. We observe that Markovianity\nbecomes a valid approximation for timescales that depend both on the form\nfactors of the interaction and on the observables of the reservoir that can be\nmeasured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Feb 2006 14:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Aug 2006 05:48:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-03-01"}
