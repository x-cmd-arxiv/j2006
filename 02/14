Then, it is shown that the data represented as a\nset of such objects may also be represented as a set of relational values\ndefined on the set of scalar domains (dual data representation).

In order to get rid of the gauge dependence, another set of\ntetrads is defined, such that the only choice we have to make is for the two\nvector fields. A particular choice is made for these two vector fields such\nthat they are gauge dependent, but the transformation properties of these\ntetrads are analogous to those already known for curved spacetimes where only\nelectromagnetic fields are present.

After\nintroducing general projection operators for hard and soft quark and gluon\ndegrees of freedom, I explicitly compute the functional integral for the hard\nquark and gluon modes in the QCD partition function. Upon appropriate choices\nfor the projection operators one recovers various well-known effective theories\nsuch as the Hard Thermal Loop/ Hard Dense Loop Effective Theories as well as\nthe High Density Effective Theory by Hong and Schaefer. I then apply the\neffective theory to cold and dense quark matter and show how it can be utilized\nto simplify the weak-coupling solution of the color-superconducting gap\nequation. In general, one considers as relevant quark degrees of freedom those\nwithin a thin layer of width 2 Lambda_q around the Fermi surface and as\nrelevant gluon degrees of freedom those with 3-momenta less than Lambda_gl. It\nturns out that it is necessary to choose Lambda_q << Lambda_gl, i.e.,\nscattering of quarks along the Fermi surface is the dominant process. Moreover,\nthis special choice of the two cutoff parameters Lambda_q and Lambda_gl\nfacilitates the power-counting of the numerous contributions in the\ngap-equation. In addition, it is demonstrated that both the energy and the\nmomentum dependence of the gap function has to be treated self-consistently in\norder to determine the imaginary part of the gap function. For quarks close to\nthe Fermi surface the imaginary part is calculated explicitly and shown to be\nof sub-subleading order in the gap equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2006 18:25:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A\nvariety of specific applications are considered - both in the context of\ncontrolled laboratory experiments, and with a view to understanding processes\noccurring in nature. The thesis is introduced and summarised in Chapter 1.\nChapter 2 studies localising relative optical phase in the canonical\ninterference process. This discussion is extended and applied in Chapter 3.\nChapter 4 discusses localising relative atomic phase in interference\nexperiments with Bose-Einstein condensates. The emergence of relative positions\nbetween particles scattering light is explored in Chapter 5. The thesis\nconcludes with an Outlook, Chapter 6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2006 20:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
