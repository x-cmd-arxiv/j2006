Introduced in this study is a new normalizing radial graded filter\n(NRGF), a simple filter for removing the radial gradient to reveal coronal\nstructure. Applied to polarized brightness observations of the corona, the NRGF\nproduces images which are striking in their detail. Total brightness white\nlight images include contributions from the F corona, stray light and other\ninstrumental contributions which need to be removed as effectively as possible\nto properly reveal the electron corona structure.

The model parameters are constrained by\nlikelihood analyses about the observed redshift and gamma-ray flux\ndistributions of the EGRET blazars.

The normalization\nbetween the GLF and XLF is consistent with the unified picture of AGNs, when\nthe beaming and a reasonable duty cycle of jet activity are taken into account.\nWe then find that only 25--50% of the EGRB can be explained by unresolved\nblazars with the best-fit LDDE parameters.

If the input or output files must be retrieved from a\nremote location, then the time required transferring the files must also be\ntaken into consideration when scheduling compute resources for the given\napplication. The central problem in this study is the coordinated management of\ncomputation and data at multiple locations and not simply data movement.\nHowever, this can be a very costly operation and efficient scheduling can be a\nchallenge if compute and data resources are mapped without network cost.

For\nnon-zero but weak coupling, perturbative methods may be used to construct a\ndimensionally reduced effective theory valid for sufficiently high temperature.\nIf the maximal chemical potential exceeds a critical value, then the free\nenergy becomes unbounded below and no genuine equilibrium state exists.\nHowever, the deconfined plasma phase remains metastable, with a lifetime which\ngrows exponentially with Nc (not Nc^2). This metastable phase persists with\nincreasing chemical potential until a phase boundary, analogous to a spinodal\ndecomposition line, is reached. Beyond this point, no long-lived locally stable\nquasi-equilibrium state exists.\n  The resulting picture for the phase diagram of the weakly coupled theory is\ncompared with results believed to hold in the strongly coupled limit of the\ntheory, based on the AdS/CFT correspondence and the study of charged black hole\nthermodynamics. The confinement/deconfinement phase transition at weak coupling\nis in qualitative agreement with the Hawking-Page phase transition in the\ngravity dual of the strongly coupled theory. The black hole thermodynamic\ninstability line may be the counterpart of the spinodal decomposition phase\nboundary found at weak coupling, but no black hole tunneling instability,\nanalogous to the instability of the weakly coupled plasma phase is currently\nknown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2006 21:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 May 2006 01:40:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Sep 2006 01:43:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In two landmark papers, Barkley\nnoticed that some of the behaviour could be explained by the inherent Euclidean\nsymmetry of these models. LeBlanc and Wulff then introduced forced Euclidean\nsymmetry-breaking (FESB) to the analysis, in the form of individual\ntranslational symmetry-breaking (TSB) perturbations and rotational\nsymmetry-breaking (RSB) perturbations; in either case, it is shown that spiral\nanchoring is a direct consequence of the FESB.\n  In this article, we provide a characterization of spiral anchoring when two\nperturbations, a TSB term and a RSB term, are combined, where the TSB term is\ncentered at the origin and the RSB term preserves rotations by multiples of\n$\\frac{2\\pi}{\\jmath^*}$, where $\\jmath^*\\geq 1$ is an integer. When\n$\\jmath^*>1$ (such as in a modified bidomain model), it is shown that spirals\nanchor at the origin, but when $\\jmath^* =1$ (such as in a planar\nreaction-diffusion-advection system), spirals generically anchor away from the\norigin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2006 20:32:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Mar 2007 16:47:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
