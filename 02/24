Our data,\ncombined with early optical data reported in the literature, shows unusual\nbehavior for both afterglows. In R-band GRB 060206 (z=4.045) experienced a slow\nearly decay, followed by a rapid increase in brightness by factor ~2.5 about 1\nhour after the burst. Its afterglow then faded in a broken power-law fashion,\nwith a smooth break at t_b=0.6 days, but with additional, less dramatic (~10%)\n``bumps and wiggles'', well detected in the densely sampled light curve. The\nR-band afterglow of GRB 060210 (z=3.91) is also unusual: the light curves was\nmore or less flat between 60 and 300 sec after the burst, followed by ~70%\nincrease at ~600 sec after the burst, after which the light curve declined as a\nt^{-1.3} power-law. Despite earlier reports to the contrary, we find that for\nGRB 060206 X-rays also more or less follow the optical decay, but with\nsignificant variations on short timescales. However, the X-ray afterglow is\ncontaminated by a nearby, variable source, which especially at late times\nobscures the behavior of the X-ray afterglow. We argue that ``anomalous''\noptical afterglows are likely to be the norm, and that the rapid variations\noften seen in Swift-XRT data would also be seen in the optical light curves,\ngiven good enough sampling. As a result, some of the often employed procedures,\nsuch as deriving the jet opening angle using a smooth broken power-law fit to\nthe optical light curves, in many cases might have a poor statistical\nsignificance. We argue that the early increase in brighness for both bursts\nmight be due to the turn-on of the external shock. Existence of such features\ncould provide valuable additional information about the burst.

A set of four narrow bands, dubbed the Manchester system, is\nused to define the infrared continuum for dusty carbon stars. The relations\nbetween the continuum colours and the strength of the dust and molecular\nfeatures are studied, and are compared to Galactic stars of similar colours.\nThe circumstellar 7-micron C2H2 band is found to be stronger at lower\nmetallicity, from a comparison of stars in the Galaxy, the LMC and the SMC.\nThis is explained by dredge-up of carbon, causing higher C/O ratios at low\nmetallicity (less O). A possible 10-micron absorption feature seen in our\nspectra may be due to C3. This band has also been identified with interstellar\nsilicate or silicon-nitrite dust. The line-to-continuum ratio of theSiC and MgS\nbands shows some indication of being lower at low metallicity. The MgS band is\nonly seen at dust temperatures below 600 K. We discuss the selection of carbon\nversus oxygen-rich AGB stars using the J-K vs. K-A colours, and show that these\ncolours are relatively insensitive to chemical type. Metal-poor carbon stars\nform amorphous carbon dust from self-produced carbon. The formation efficiency\nof oxygen-rich dust depends more strongly on metallicity.

Despite of its importance, this design issue received little\nattention so far. In this paper, we address this design issue for the case of\nbinary erasure channel.\n  We prove that density-efficient capacity-approaching LDPC codes satisfy a so\ncalled \"flatness condition\". We show an asymptotic approximation to the number\nof decoding iterations. Based on these facts, we propose an approximated\noptimization approach to finding the codes with good decoding speed. We further\nshow that the optimal codes in the sense of decoding speed are\n\"right-concentrated\". That is, the degrees of check nodes concentrate around\nthe average right degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Feb 2006 20:14:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-08-27"}

This approach has left several long-standing, but common\nproblems unresolved in which the standard approaches produce inferior results\nor give no guidance at all. We view the current reconstruction process as\nunnecessarily broken into separate problems.

This allows for varying time delays\nappropriate to the data and simultaneously helps decide on embedding dimension.\nA second new statistic, undersampling, acts as a check against overly long time\ndelays and overly large embedding dimension. Our approach is more flexible than\nthose currently used, but is more directly connected with the mathematical\nrequirements of embedding. In addition, the statistics developed guide the user\nby allowing optimization and warning when embedding parameters are chosen\nbeyond what the data can support.
