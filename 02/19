Furthermore, the general ingredients of the classical spectral density\nmethod (CSDM) are presented with insights for systematic nonperturbative\napproximations to study conveniently the macroscopic properties of a wide\nvariety of classical many-body systems also involving phase transitions. The\nmethod is implemented by means of key ideas for exploring the spectrum of\nelementary excitations and the damping effects within a unified formalism.\nThen, the effectiveness of the CSDM is tested with explicit calculations for\nthe classical $d$-dimensional spin-$S$ Heisenberg ferromagnetic model with\nlong-range exchange interactions decaying as $r^{-p}$ ($p>d$) with distance $r$\nbetween spins and in the presence of an external magnetic field. The analysis\nof the thermodynamic and critical properties, performed by means of the CSDM to\nthe lowest order of approximation, shows clearly that nontrivial results can be\nobtained in a relatively simple manner already to this lower stage. The basic\nspectral density equations for the next higher order level are also presented\nand the damping of elementary spin excitations in the low temperature regime is\nstudied.

In the case where the positive\nintegers b,c satisfy bc<4, the recurrence is related to the root systems of\nfinite-dimensional rank 2 Lie algebras; when bc>4, the recurrence is related to\nKac-Moody rank 2 Lie algebras of hyperbolic type. Here we investigate the\nborderline cases bc=4, corresponding to Kac-Moody Lie algebras of affine type.\nIn these cases, we show that the Laurent polynomials arising from the recurence\ncan be viewed as generating functions that enumerate the perfect matchings of\ncertain graphs. By providing combinatorial interpretations of the individual\ncoefficients of these Laurent polynomials, we establish their positivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2006 03:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 2 Apr 2006 21:20:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 Oct 2006 17:38:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 2007 00:05:29 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 17 May 2007 18:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
