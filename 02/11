Whilst there is a strong dependence on the choice of priors, each\ncosmological probe displays distinctive characteristics in their redshift\nsensitivities. In the case of proposed future surveys, a SNAP-like supernova\nsurvey probes a mean redshift of z ~ 0.3, with baryon oscillations and cosmic\nshear at z ~ 0.6.

These corrections comprise a Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant\nmultiplied by universal non-trivial functions of the common modulus $\\sigma$\nand the dilaton $\\phi$. The model exhibits several features of cosmological\ninterest, including the transition between deceleration and acceleration\nphases. By considering some phenomenologically motivated ansatzs for one of the\nscalars and/or the scale factor (of the universe), we also construct a number\nof interesting inflationary potentials. In all examples under consideration, we\nfind that the model leads only to a standard inflation ($w \\geq -1$) when the\nnumerical coefficient $\\delta$ associated with modulus-GB coupling is positive,\nwhile the model can lead also to a non-standard inflation ($w<-1$), if $\\delta$\nis negative. In the absence of (or trivial) coupling between the GB term and\nthe scalars, there is no crossing between the $w< -1$ and $w> -1$ phases, while\nthis is possible with non-trivial GB couplings, even for constant dilaton phase\nof the standard picture. Within our model, after a sufficient amount of e-folds\nof expansion, the rolling of both fields $\\phi$ and $\\sigma$ can be small. In\nturn, any possible violation of equivalence principle or deviations from the\nstandard general relativity may be small enough to easily satisfy all\nastrophysical and cosmological constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2006 20:56:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Apr 2006 11:01:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Jul 2006 14:46:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 29 Oct 2006 22:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The style of exposition is\nintermediate between survey and detailed monograph: some results are supplied\nwith detailed proofs, while the other are cited without proofs but with\nreferences to the original papers.\n  The content is briefly as follows. Starting with basic properties of\nalgebraic homogeneous spaces and related objects, such as induced\nrepresentations, we focus the attention on homogeneous spaces of reductive\ngroups and introduce two important invariants, called complexity and rank. For\nthe embedding theory it is important that homogeneous spaces of small\ncomplexity admit a transparent combinatorial description of their equivariant\nembeddings. We consider the Luna-Vust theory of equivariant embeddings, paying\nspecial attention to the case of complexity not greater than one. A special\nchapter is devoted to spherical varieties (= embeddings of homogeneous spaces\nof complexity zero), due to their particular importance and ubiquity. A\nrelation between equivariant embedding theory and equivariant symplectic\ngeometry is also discussed. The book contains several classification results\n(homogeneous spaces of small complexity, etc).\n  The text presented here is not in a final form, and the author will be very\ngrateful to any interested reader for his comments and/or remarks, which may be\nsent to the author by email.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2006 19:30:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We derive\na self-consistent Hartree-Fock potential from the renormalized N3LO interaction\nmodel. The corresponding Gamow one-body eigenstates are generated in a plane\nwave basis in order to build a Gamow shell-model set of basis states for the\nclosed shell nuclei 4He and 16O. We address also the problem of representing a\nrealistic nucleon-nucleon interaction in a two-particle Berggren basis in the\nlaboratory frame. To achieve this, an expansion of matrix elements of the\nresidual nucleon-nucleon interaction in a finite set of harmonic oscillator\nwave functions is used. We show that all loosely bound and narrow resonant\nstates converge surprisingly fast. Even broad resonances in these two-particle\nvalence systems converge within a reasonable number of harmonic oscillator\nfunctions. Examples of 6He and 18O Gamow shell-model calculations using 4He and\n16}O as closed shell cores are presented. This procedure allows Gamow\nshell-model calculations to be performed with all realistic nucleon-nucleon\ninteractions and with either momentum or position space representations for the\nGamow basis. The possibility to remove the center of mass spuriosity of Gamow\nshell-model nuclear states with this method is also discussed.

The present study centers around two questions. First, is there a\nstrong correlation between the development of a neutron skin and the emergence\nof low-energy isovector dipole strength? Second, could one use the recently\nmeasured Pygmy dipole resonance in 130Sn and 132Sn to discriminate among\ntheoretical models? For the first question we found that while a strong\ncorrelation between the neutron skin and the Pygmy dipole resonance exists, a\nmild anti-correlation develops beyond 120Sn. The answer to the second question\nsuggests that models with overly large neutron skins--and thus stiff symmetry\nenergies--are in conflict with experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2006 01:09:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

This is accomplished by classifying\nstates of the system by the total spin of the coupled electron and nuclear\nsystem that commutes with the system Hamiltonian. These states are used in\nenumerating and finding the exact solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger\nequation.
