An extensive series of tests and supplemental\nobservations with the VLA provide strong evidence against systematic errors or\nradio point sources being the source of the observed excess power. The dominant\nsource of anisotropy on these scales is expected to arise from the\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in a population of distant galaxy clusters. If\nthe excess power is due to the SZ effect, we can place constraints on the\nnormalization of the matter power spectrum sigma_8 = 1.03^{+0.20}_{-0.29} at\n68% confidence. The distribution of pixel fluxes in the BIMA images are found\nto be consistent with simulated observations of the expected SZ background and\nrule out instrumental noise or radio sources as the source of the observed\nexcess power with similar confidence to the detection of excess power.\nFollow-up optical observations to search for galaxy over-densities\nanti-correlated with flux in the BIMA images, as might be expected from the SZ\neffect, proved to be inconclusive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Feb 2006 02:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Apr 2006 23:32:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

A simple\nimpeller model drives a flow which can generate a growing magnetic field,\ndepending upon the magnetic Reynolds number, Rm, and the fluid Reynolds number.\nWhen the flow is laminar, the dynamo transition is governed by a simple\nthreshold in Rm, above which a growing magnetic eigenmode is observed. The\neigenmode is primarily a dipole field tranverse to axis of symmetry of the\nflow. In saturation the Lorentz force slows the flow such that the magnetic\neigenmode becomes marginally stable. For turbulent flow, the dynamo eigenmode\nis suppressed. The mechanism of suppression is due to a combination of a time\nvarying large-scale field and the presence of fluctuation driven currents which\neffectively enhance the magnetic diffusivity. For higher Rm a dynamo reappears,\nhowever the structure of the magnetic field is often different from the laminar\ndynamo; it is dominated by a dipolar magnetic field which is aligned with the\naxis of symmetry of the mean-flow, apparently generated by fluctuation-driven\ncurrents. The fluctuation-driven currents have been studied by applying a weak\nmagnetic field to laminar and turbulent flows. The magnetic fields generated by\nthe fluctuations are significant: a dipole moment aligned with the symmetry\naxis of the mean-flow is generated similar to those observed in the experiment,\nand both toroidal and poloidal flux expulsion are observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2006 23:30:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Nov 2006 16:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}
