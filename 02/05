They proved that, in the finite dimensional\ncase, the corresponding states have vanishing entropy density, but they did not\nprove that they are entangled.\n  In the present note this entropy result is extended to the infinite\ndimensional case under the assumption of finite speed of hopping. Then the\nentanglement problem is discussed for spin 1/2, entangled Markov chains\ngenerated by a binary symmetric channel with hopping probability $1-q$. The von\nNeumann entropy of these states, restricted on a sublattice is explicitly\ncalculated and shown to be independent of the size of the sublattice.
