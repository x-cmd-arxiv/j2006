The dual gauge theory is also\nconstructed explicitly and is given by a time-dependent supersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory living on the boundary. Apart from the usual terms that are\ndictated by the geometry, our gauge theory action features also a\ntime-dependent axion coupling and a time-dependent gauge coupling. Both of\nwhich are necessary due to the presence of a nontrivial dilaton and axion\nprofile in the supergravity solution. The proposal is supported by a precise\nmatching in the symmetries and functional dependence on the null coordinate of\nthe two theories. As applications, we show how the bulk Einstein equation may\nbe reproduced from the gauge theory. We also study and compare the behaviour of\nthe field theory two-point functions. We find that the two-point function\ncomputed by using duality is different from that by doing a direct field theory\ncomputation. In particular the spacetime singularity is not seen in our gauge\ntheory result, suggesting that the spacetime singularity may be resolved in the\ngauge theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Feb 2006 14:21:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2006 06:46:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-03"}

This process is accompanied by a very characteristic\nbehaviour of the invariant curves prior to their collision, which we call\n'exponential evolution of peaks'.\n  This observation is then used to give a rigorous description of non-smooth\nsaddle-node bifurcations.
