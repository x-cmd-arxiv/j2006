Considered only in terms of\ncold two-fluid theory, instability persists to arbitrarily small values of X,\nand the maximum growth rate is of order the orbital frequency except for the\nrange m_e/m_i < |X| < 1, where it can be rather smaller. In this range, field\naligned with rotation (X > 0) produces slower growth than anti-aligned field (X\n< 0).

When |X| < m_e/m_i, new unstable\n\"electromagnetic-rotational\" modes appear that do not depend on the equilibrium\nmagnetic field.

The addition of a warm dark matter component to the initial\npower spectrum results in a delay in the collapse of high density gas at the\ncenter of the most massive halo in the simulation and, as a result, an increase\nin the virial mass of this halo at the onset of baryon collapse.

The final focal ratio is f/5.\nThe telescope is instrumented by a wide-area, multiband CCD camera and a pair\nof fiber-fed double spectrographs. Novel features of the telescope include: (1)\nA 3 degree diameter (0.65 m) focal plane that has excellent image quality and\nsmall geometrical distortions over a wide wavelength range (3000 to 10,600\nAngstroms) in the imaging mode, and good image quality combined with very small\nlateral and longitudinal color errors in the spectroscopic mode. The unusual\nrequirement of very low distortion is set by the demands of\ntime-delay-and-integrate (TDI) imaging; (2) Very high precision motion to\nsupport open loop TDI observations; and (3) A unique wind baffle/enclosure\nconstruction to maximize image quality and minimize construction costs.

In the second\npart I give a short overview on the circumgalactic gaseous environment of other\nnearby spiral galaxies. Multi-wavelength observations demonstrate that neutral\nand ionized gaseous halos of galaxies are common, and that they extend deep\ninto intergalactic space. These studies suggest that the gaseous material\naround spiral galaxies is tightly connected to the on-going hierarchical\nformation and evolution of these galaxies. In the last part of this article I\nsummarize recent quasar absorption-line measurements of the local intergalactic\nmedium. In accordance with cosmological simulations, absorption-line studies in\nthe far-ultraviolet indicate that both the photoionized Ly alpha forest and the\nshock-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium harbor a substantial fraction of the\nbaryons in the local Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2006 15:13:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-03"}

A scalar potential model (SPM) that links the\ngalaxy scale $z$ to the cosmological scale $z$ of the Hubble Law is postulated.\nSeveral differences among galaxy types suggest that spiral galaxies are Sources\nand that early type, lenticular, and irregular galaxies are Sinks of a scalar\npotential field. The morphology-radius and the intragalactic medium cluster\nobservations support the movement of matter from Source galaxies to Sink\ngalaxies. A cell structure of galaxy groups and clusters is proposed to resolve\na paradox concerning the scalar potential like the Olber's paradox concerning\nlight. For the sample galaxies, the ratio of the luminosity of Source galaxies\nto the luminosity of Sink galaxies approaches $2.7 \\pm 0.1$. An equation is\nderived from sample data, which is anisotropic and inhomogeneous, relating $z$\nof and the distance $D$ to galaxies. The calculated $z$ has a correlation\ncoefficient of 0.88 with the measured $z$ for a sample of 32 spiral galaxies\nwith $D$ calculated using Cepheid variable stars. The equation is consistent\nwith $z<0$ observations of close galaxies. At low cosmological distances, the\nequation reduces to $z \\approx \\exp(KD) \\, -1 \\approx KD$, where $K$ is a\nconstant, positive value. The equation predicts $z$ from galaxies over 18 Gpc\ndistant approaches a constant value on the order of 500. The SPM of $z$\nprovides a physical basis for the $z$ of particle photons. Further, the SPM\nqualitatively suggests the discrete variations in $z$, which was reported by W.\nG. Tifft, 1997, Astrophy.

In each round, a gambler must pull one of\n$K$ arms of a slot machine, without any foreknowledge of their payouts, except\nthat they are uniformly bounded. A standard objective is to minimize the\ngambler's regret, defined as the gambler's total payout minus the largest\npayout which would have been achieved by any fixed arm, in hindsight. Note that\nthe gambler is only told the payout for the arm actually chosen, not for the\nunchosen arms.\n  Almost all previous work on this problem assumed the payouts to be\nnon-adaptive, in the sense that the distribution of the payout of arm $j$ in\nround $i$ is completely independent of the choices made by the gambler on\nrounds $1, \\dots, i-1$. In the more general model of adaptive payouts, the\npayouts in round $i$ may depend arbitrarily on the history of past choices made\nby the algorithm.\n  We present a new algorithm for this problem, and prove nearly optimal\nguarantees for the regret against both non-adaptive and adaptive adversaries.\nAfter $T$ rounds, our algorithm has regret $O(\\sqrt{T})$ with high probability\n(the tail probability decays exponentially).

This\ntradeoff is precisely known in the case of i.i.d. Rayleigh-fading, for T>=\nn_t+n_r-1 where T is the number of time slots over which coding takes place and\nn_t,n_r are the number of transmit and receive antennas respectively. For T <\nn_t+n_r-1, only upper and lower bounds on the D-MG tradeoff are available.\n  In this paper, we present a complete solution to the problem of explicitly\nconstructing D-MG optimal ST codes, i.e., codes that achieve the D-MG tradeoff\nfor any number of receive antennas. We do this by showing that for the square\nminimum-delay case when T=n_t=n, cyclic-division-algebra (CDA) based ST codes\nhaving the non-vanishing determinant property are D-MG optimal. While\nconstructions of such codes were previously known for restricted values of n,\nwe provide here a construction for such codes that is valid for all n.\n  For the rectangular, T > n_t case, we present two general techniques for\nbuilding D-MG-optimal rectangular ST codes from their square counterparts. A\nbyproduct of our results establishes that the D-MG tradeoff for all T>= n_t is\nthe same as that previously known to hold for T >= n_t + n_r -1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2006 00:19:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-07-13"}

Our main conclusion is that the properly\nrenormalized four dimensional theory never forgets its higher dimensional\norigin. In particular, the coefficients of the neccessary extra counterterms in\nthe four dimensional theory are determined in a precise way. We check our\nresults by studying the reduction of $QED_4$ on a two-torus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2006 10:14:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2006 13:53:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 May 2006 10:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

From the\ntimedependent numerical solution of the two-particle wavefunction of the\nscattering carriers we compute their entanglement evolution for different spin\nconfigurations: two electrons with the same spin, with different spin, singlet,\nand triplet spin state. The procedure allows to evaluate the mechanisms that\ngovern entanglement creation and their connection with the characteristic\nphysical parameters and initial conditions of the system. The cases in which\nthe evolution of entanglement is similar to the one obtained for\ndistinguishable particles are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2006 11:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
