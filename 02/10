The FeH bands show a systematic growth as the star gets cooler. We do\nnot find any contamination by CrH in the relevant spectral region. We are able\nto model cool and rapidly-rotating spectra from warmer, slowly-rotating spectra\nutilizing an interpolation scheme based on optical depth scaling.

The characteristic length scale associated with this decay is the\nspin diffusion length. The DD model also predicts that this length is different\nfor ``upstream'' electrons traveling in a decelerating electric field than for\n``downstream'' electrons traveling in an accelerating field. However this\npicture ignores energy quantization in confined systems (e.g. quantum wires)\nand therefore fails to capture the non-trivial influence of subband structure\non spin relaxation.

The Holstein\nmodel electron-phonon coupling is momentum independent while the breathing\ncoupling increases monotonically with the phonon momentum. We find that for a\nlinear or tight binding electron dispersion: i) for the same value of the\ndimensionless coupling the quasiparticle renormalization at small momentum in\nthe breathing polaron is much smaller, ii) the quasiparticle renormalization at\nsmall momentum in the breathing polaron increases with phonon frequency unlike\nin the Holstein model where it decreases, iii) in the Holstein model the\nquasiparticle dispersion displays a kink and a small gap at an excitation\nenergy equal to the phonon frequency w0 while in the breathing model it\ndisplays two gaps, one at excitation energy w0 and another one at 2w0. These\ndifferences have two reasons: first, the momentum of the relevant scattered\nphonons increases with increasing polaron momentum and second, the breathing\nbare coupling is an increasing function of the phonon momentum. These result in\nan effective electron-phonon coupling for the breathing model which is an\nincreasing function of the total polaron momentum, such that the small momentum\npolaron is in the weak coupling regime while the large momentum one is in the\nstrong coupling regime. However the first reason does not hold if the free\nelectron dispersion has low energy states separated by large momentum, as in a\nhigher dimensional system for example, in which situation the difference\nbetween the two models becomes less significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2006 22:18:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

A new method for evaluating the QCD predictions at\nmoderate energies is proposed, based on a modified couplant, which is\nconstructed to be free from Landau singularity and less renormalization scheme\ndependent than the conventional couplant. The modified couplant contains an\nadjustable parameter, which may be used to improve the modified perturbative\npredictions in low orders by utilizing some information outside of perturbation\ntheory. This parameter is fixed by matching the modified predictions to the\nphenomenological expression for the effective charge in the interquark\npotential.

In particular, the reaction pp ->\npppi0 is highly sensitive to short-range mechanisms, because isospin\nconservation suppresses the otherwise dominant pion exchange term. However, the\nrelative importance of the various reaction processes has been very difficult\nto establish.\n  After reviewing the state-of-the-art of the theoretical approaches, we\naddress the validity of the distorted-wave Born approximation (DWBA) through\nits link to the time-ordered perturbation theory (TOPT) diagrams. As the energy\nof the exchanged pion is not determined unambiguously within the\nnon-relativistic formalism underlying DWBA, we analyse several options to\ndetermine which one is closer to TOPT.\n  The S-matrix technique, successfully used below threshold, is shown to\nreproduce the results of TOPT for the re-scattering mechanism in pi0\nproduction.

With a new insight into fundamental\nproperties of quantum hardcores, we present three new quantum hardcore\nfunctions for any (strong) quantum one-way function. We also give a \"quantum\"\nsolution to Damgard's question (CRYPTO'88) on a classical hardcore property of\nhis pseudorandom generator, by proving its quantum hardcore property. Our major\ntechnical tool is the new notion of quantum list-decoding of \"classical\"\nerror-correcting codes (rather than \"quantum\" error-correcting codes), which is\ndefined on the platform of computational complexity theory and computational\ncryptography (rather than information theory). In particular, we give a simple\nbut powerful criterion that makes a polynomial-time computable classical block\ncode (seen as a function) a quantum hardcore for all quantum one-way functions.\nOn their own interest, we construct efficient quantum list-decoding algorithms\nfor classical block codes whose associated quantum states (called codeword\nstates) form a nearly phase-orthogonal basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Feb 2006 04:59:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Mar 2008 11:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2009 16:04:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-07-20"}
