After having discarded the possibility that the\nsignal can be explained by a high density local source population, we find no\nalternatives to assuming that - at variance with all the other extragalactic\npopulations studied so far, and in particular with optically selected quasars -\nradio sources responsible for the large-scale clustering signal were\nincreasingly less clustered with increasing look-back time, up to at least z=1.\nThe data are accurately accounted for in terms of a bias function which\ndecreases with increasing redshift, mirroring the evolution with cosmic time of\nthe characteristic halo mass, M_{star}, entering the non linear regime. In the\nframework of the `concordance cosmology', the effective halo mass controlling\nthe bias parameter is found to decrease from about 10^{15} M_{sun}/h at z=0 to\nthe value appropriate for optically selected quasars, 10^{13} M_{sun}/h, at\nz=1.5. This suggests that, in the redshift range probed by the data, the\nclustering evolution of radio sources is ruled by the growth of large-scale\nstructure, and that they are associated with the densest environments\nvirializing at any cosmic epoch. The data provide only loose constraints on\nradio source clustering at z>1 so we cannot rule out the possibility that at\nthese redshifts the clustering evolution of radio sources enters a different\nregime, perhaps similar to that found for optically selected quasars. The\ndependence of w(theta) on cosmological parameters is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2006 14:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

Recently\ntheoretical models have been developed to predict the protein folding rate\nconsidering the relationships of the process with tolopological parameters\nderived from the native (atomic-solved) protein structures. Previous works\nclassified proteins in two different groups exhibiting either a\nsingle-exponential or a multi-exponential folding kinetics. It is well known\nthat these two classes of proteins are related to different protein structural\nfeatures. The increasing number of available experimental kinetic data allows\nthe application to the problem of a machine learning approach, in order to\npredict the kinetic order of the folding process starting from the experimental\ndata so far collected. This information can be used to improve the prediction\nof the folding rate. In this work first we describe a support vector\nmachine-based method (SVM-KO) to predict for a given protein the kinetic order\nof the folding process. Using this method we can classify correctly 78% of the\nfolding mechanisms over a set of 63 experimental data. Secondly we focus on the\nprediction of the logarithm of the folding rate. This value can be obtained as\na linear regression task with a SVM-based method. In this paper we show that\nlinear correlation of the predicted with experimental data can improve when the\nregression task is computed over two different sets, instead of one, each of\nthem composed by the proteins with a correctly predicted two state or\nmultistate kinetic order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Feb 2006 13:26:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
