The starquakes of a\nmagnetar shear its external magnetic field, which becomes non-potential and is\nthreaded by an electric current. Once twisted, the magnetosphere cannot untwist\nimmediately because of its self-induction. The self-induction electric field\nlifts particles from the stellar surface, accelerates them, and initiates\navalanches of pair creation in the magnetosphere. The created plasma corona\nmaintains the electric current demanded by curl(B) and regulates the\nself-induction e.m.f. by screening. This corona persists in dynamic\nequilibrium: it is continually lost to the stellar surface on the\nlight-crossing time of 10^{-4} s and replenished with new particles. In\nessence, the twisted magnetosphere acts as an accelerator that converts the\ntoroidal field energy to particle kinetic energy. Using a direct numerical\nexperiment, we show that the corona self-organizes quickly (on a millisecond\ntimescale) into a quasi-steady state, with voltage ~1 GeV along the magnetic\nlines. The heating rate of the corona is ~10^{36} erg/s, in agreement with the\nobserved persistent, high-energy output of magnetars. We deduce that a static\ntwist that is suddenly implanted into the magnetosphere will decay on a\ntimescale of 1-10 yrs. The particles accelerated in the corona impact the solid\ncrust, knock out protons, and regulate the column density of the hydrostatic\natmosphere of the star. The transition layer between the atmosphere and the\ncorona is the likely source of the observed 100-keV emission from magnetars.\nThe corona emits curvature radiation and can supply the observed IR-optical\nluminosity.

The latter effect implies that\nfollow-up observations in other wavebands (e.g., 90 GHz, X-ray) of single\nfrequency surveys will be required.

Using\noptical/IR photometric-redshift information, we search for correlations induced\nby two separate effects: (1) cosmic magnification of background sub-mm sources\nby foreground dark matter haloes traced by optical galaxies at lower redshifts;\nand (2) galaxy clustering due to sub-mm and optical sources tracing the same\npopulation of haloes where their redshift distributions overlap.

We describe turbo\ndecoding on the BEC which is simpler than turbo decoding on other channels.
