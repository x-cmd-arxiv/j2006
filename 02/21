We apply Lynden-Bell's\nmagnetic tower scenario to the interior of a massive rotating star after the\ncore has collapsed to form a black hole with an accretion disk or a millisecond\nmagnetar acting as a central engine. We solve the force-free Grad-Shafranov\nequation to calculate the magnetic structure and growth of a tower embedded in\na stellar environment. The pressure of the toroidal magnetic field,\ncontinuously generated by differential rotation of the central engine, drives a\nrapid expansion which becomes vertically collimated after lateral force balance\nwith the surrounding gas pressure is reached. The collimation naturally occurs\nbecause hoop stress concentrates magnetic field toward the rotation axis and\ninhibits lateral expansion. This leads to the growth of a self-collimated\nmagnetic tower. When embedded in a massive star, the supersonic expansion of\nthe tower drives a strong bow shock behind which an over-pressured cocoon\nforms. The cocoon confines the tower by supplying collimating pressure and\nprovides stabilization against disruption due to MHD instabilities. Because the\ntower consists of closed field lines starting and ending on the central engine,\nmixing of baryons from the cocoon into the tower is suppressed. The channel\ncleared by the growing tower is thus plausibly free of baryons and allows the\nescape of magnetic energy from the central engine through the star. While\npropagating down the stellar density gradient, the tower accelerates and\nbecomes relativistic. During the expansion, fast collisionless reconnection\nbecomes possible resulting in dissipation of magnetic energy which may be\nresponsible for GRB prompt emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2006 18:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 May 2006 00:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-11"}

We find that\nthe binary frequency is higher for very low mass stars and high-mass brown\ndwarfs than for lower-mass brown dwarfs, implying either a decline in frequency\nor a shift to smaller separations for the lowest mass binaries. Combining these\nresults with multiplicity statistics for higher-mass Taurus members suggests a\ngradual decline in binary frequency and separation toward low masses. The\nimplication is that the distinct binary properties of very low-mass systems are\nset during formation and that the formation process is similar to the process\nwhich creates higher-mass stellar binaries, but occurs on a smaller scale. We\nshow that there are no planets or very low-mass brown dwarfs with mass >3 M_J\nat projected separation >40 AU orbiting any of the Taurus members in our\nsample. We identify several BDs with significant (>1 mag) V-band excesses. The\nexcesses appear to be correlated with signatures of accretion, and if\nattributed to accretion luminosity, may imply mass accretion rates several\norders of magnitude above those inferred from line-profile analyses.

It starts with an informal discussion, using numerical\nsimulations, of various examples of 2D growth processes and their connections\nwith statistical mechanics. SLE is then introduced and Schramm's argument\nmapping conformally invariant interfaces to SLE is explained. A substantial\npart of the review is devoted to reveal the deep connections between\nstatistical mechanics and processes, and more specifically to the present\ncontext, between 2D critical systems and SLE. Some of the SLE remarkable\nproperties are explained, as well as the tools for computing with SLE. This\nreview has been written with the aim of filling the gap between the\nmathematical and the physical literatures on the subject.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Feb 2006 16:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

By this perturbative tool the desired finite quantities are\nproduced by differences of infinities. This paper gives a new non-perturbative\napproach to this problem. Namely, the Hilbert space on which the quantum\nHamilton operator $H$ is acting, is decomposed into subspaces, called Zeeman\nzones, which are invariant under the actions both of $H$ and the natural\ncomplex Heisenberg group representation. Thus well defined particle theory and\nzonal geometry can be developed on each zone separately. One of the most\nsurprising result is that the quantities which appear as infinities on the\nglobal setting become well defined finite ones on the zonal setting. For\ninstance, both the Wiener-Kac and the Dirac-Feynman kernels become of the trace\nclass on the zones, both defining the corresponding zonal measures on the\npath-spaces rigorously.\n  The Hamilton operators, $H$, considered in this paper are those corresponding\nto electrons orbiting in a constant magnetic field. This is one of the most\nimportant Hamiltonians, introduced for explaining the Zeeman effect. This\nHamiltonian is identified with the Laplacian of certain Riemannian,so called\nZeeman manifolds.

Thus a\nzone exhibits the magnetic state of the particle occupying the zone. All the\nimportant spectral theoretical objects are explicitly established.

The effect of the correlations in the ground state properties of the\nnuclear matter and neutron matter is studied. The nucleon effective mass and\nequation of state (EOS) are very sensitive to short range correlations. In\nparticular, if the pion contact term is neglected a softening of the EOS is\npredicted. Correlations have also an important effect on the neutron matter EOS\nwhich presents no binding but only a very shallow minimum contrary to the\nWalecka model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2006 08:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
