These density\ninhomogeneities are expected to develop spontaneously in radiation-dominated\naccretion disks where magnetic pressure exceeds gas pressure, even in the\npresence of magnetorotational instability. They increase the rate at which\nradiation escapes from the disk, and may allow disks to exceed the Eddington\nlimit by a substantial factor. We first generalize the theory of photon bubbles\nto include the effects of finite optical depths and radiation damping.\nModifications to the diffusion law at low optical depth tend to fill in the\nlow-density regions of photon bubbles, while radiation damping inhibits the\nformation of photon bubbles at large radii, small accretion rates, and small\nheights above the equatorial plane. Accretion disks dominated by photon bubble\ntransport may reach luminosities of 10 to >100 times the Eddington limit (L_E),\ndepending on the mass of the central object, while remaining geometrically\nthin. However, photon bubble-dominated disks with alpha-viscosity are subject\nto the same thermal and viscous instabilities that plague standard radiation\npressure-dominated disks, suggesting that they may be intrinsically unsteady.\nPhoton bubbles can lead to a \"core-halo\" vertical disk structure. In\nsuper-Eddington disks the halo forms the base of a wind, which carries away\nsubstantial energy and mass, but not enough to prevent the luminosity from\nexceeding L_E. Photon bubble-dominated disks may have smaller color corrections\nthan standard accretion disks of the same luminosity. They remain viable\ncontenders for some ultraluminous X-ray sources and may play a role in the\nrapid growth of supermassive black holes at high redshift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2006 18:12:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

We find that the\nradial profile of the baryonic-to-dark-matter ratio is self-similar for all\ngalaxies, when scaled to the radius where the contribution of the baryonic mass\nto the rotation curve equals that of the dark matter (R_X). We argue that this\nis due to the quasi-exponential nature of disks and rotation curves that are\nnearly flat after an initial rise. The radius R_X is found to correlate most\nstrongly with baryonic rotation speed, such that galaxies with R_X measurements\nthat lie further out in their disks rotate faster. This quantity also\ncorrelates very strongly with stellar mass, Hubble type, and observed rotation\nspeed; B-band central surface brightness is less related to R_X than these\nother galaxy properties. Most of the galaxies in our sample appear to be close\nto maximal disk. For these galaxies, we find that maximum observed rotation\nspeeds are tightly correlated with maximum rotation speeds predicted from the\nbaryon distributions, such that one can create a Tully-Fisher relation based on\nsurface photometry and redshifts alone. Finally, we compare our data to the NFW\nparameterization for dark matter profiles with and without including adiabatic\ncontraction as it is most commonly implemented. Fits are generally poor, and\nall but 2 galaxies are better fit if adiabatic contraction is not performed. In\norder to have better fits, and especially to accommodate adiabatic contraction,\nbaryons would need to contribute very little to the total mass in the inner\nparts of galaxies, seemingly in contrast with other observational constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Feb 2006 19:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

In many disks, there is evidence that a\nlarge mass of dust is in grains with millimeter and centimeter sizes, more\nsimilar to \"sand and pebbles\" than to grains. Smaller grains (with\nmicron-sizes) exist closer to the disk surface, which also contains much\nsmaller particles, e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

First, we derive parameters\nof the effective Hubbard-type Hamiltonian for the isolated $t_{2g}$ bands using\nnewly developed downfolding method for the kinetic-energy part and a hybrid\napproach, based on the combination of the random-phase approximation and the\nconstraint local-density approximation, for the screened Coulomb interaction\npart.

Even though the crystal-field splitting is not particularly large to\nquench the orbital degrees of freedom, the crystal distortion imposes a severe\nconstraint on the form of the possible orbital states, which favor the\nformation of the experimentally observed magnetic structures in YTiO$_3$,\nYVO$_$, and LaVO$_3$ even at the HF level. Beyond the HF approximation, the\ncorrelations effects systematically improve the agreement with the experimental\ndata.

We present new\nevidence that shows that efficiency is maintained by a liquidity imbalance that\nco-moves with the imbalance of buyer vs. seller initiated transactions. For\nexample, during a period where there is an excess of buyer initiated\ntransactions, there is also more liquidity for buy orders than sell orders, so\nthat buy orders generate smaller and less frequent price responses than sell\norders. At the moment a buy order is placed the transaction sign imbalance\ntends to dominate, generating a price impact. However, the liquidity imbalance\nrapidly increases with time, so that after a small number of time steps it\ncancels all the inefficiency caused by the transaction sign imbalance, bounding\nthe price impact. While the view presented by Bouchaud et al. of a fixed and\ntemporary bare price impact is self-consistent and formally correct, we argue\nthat viewing this in terms of a variable but permanent price impact provides a\nsimpler and more natural view. This is in the spirit of the original conjecture\nof Lillo and Farmer, but generalized to allow for finite time lags in the build\nup of the liquidity imbalance after a transaction.

These changes indicate that the dispersion of\nresults that remains after all artifacts are excluded inevitably accompanies\nany measurements and reflects very basic features of our world. In our\nresearch, we have come to the conclusion that this dispersion of results is the\neffect of space-time fluctuations, which, in their turn, are caused by the\nmovement of the measured object in an anisotropic gravitational field. Among\nother things, this conclusion means that the examination of the detailed\npattern of distributions obtained from the results of measurement of the\ndynamics of processes of different nature discovers laws, which cannot be\nrevealed with traditional methods for the analysis of time series.

Using the Bose-Hubbard model we study an\narray of Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in optical potentials and coupled to\none another to form a ring. By rotating the ring so that each particle acquires\non average half a quantum of superfluid flow, it is possible to create a\nmultiparticle superposition of all the particles rotating and all the particles\nstationary. Under certain conditions it is possible to scale up the number of\nparticles to form a macroscopic superposition. The simplicity of the model has\nallowed us to study macroscopic superpositions at an atomic level for different\nvariables. Here we concentrate on the tunnelling strength between the\npotentials. Further investigation remains important, because it could lead us\nto making an ultra-precise quantum-limited gyroscope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2006 15:15:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2006 16:54:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Aug 2007 09:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

Several general\ntheorems aimed at characterizing sets of states with which the parties can\nsucceed in such a task are proven. These include (1) a maximum for the number\nof states when the Schmidt rank of every outcome must be at least a given\nminimum; (2) an upper bound (equal to the dimension of Hilbert space if\nentanglement need not be preserved) for the sum over Schmidt ranks of the\ninitial states when only one-way classical communication is allowed; and (3)\nseparately, a necessary and a sufficient condition on the states such that\ntheir original Schmidt ranks can always be preserved. It is shown that our\nbound on the sum of Schmidt ranks can be exceeded if two-way communication is\npermitted, and this includes the case that entanglement need not be preserved,\nso that this sum can exceed the dimension of Hilbert space. Such questions,\nconcerning how the various results are effected by the resources used by the\nparties are addressed for each theorem. This subject is closely related to the\nproblem of locally purifying an entangled state from a mixed state, which is of\ndirect relevance to teleportation and dense coding using a mixed-state\nresource. In an appendix, I give an extremely simple and transparent proof of\n\"non-locality without entanglement\", a phenomenon originally discussed by\nBennett and co-workers several years ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2006 15:42:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Oct 2006 20:30:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jun 2007 18:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For short times, the polarization of\nthe central spin shows a gaussian decay, and at later times it revives\ndisplaying nonmonotonic time dependence.
