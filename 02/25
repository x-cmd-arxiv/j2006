We have used STIS on HST to\nobtain UV spectra of all four sources, to study \"core samples\" of the SN 1006\ninterior. The line of sight closest to the center of the SNR shell, passing\nonly 2.0 arcmin away, is to a V = 19.5 QSO at z = 1.026. Its spectrum shows\nbroad Fe II absorption lines, asymmetric with red wings broader than blue. The\nsimilarity of these profiles to those seen in the SM star, which is 2.8 arcmin\nfrom the center in the opposite direction, confirms the existence of a bulge on\nthe far side of SN 1006. The Fe II equivalent widths in the QSO spectrum are ~\n50% greater than in the SM star, suggesting that somewhat more iron may be\npresent within SN 1006 than studies of the SM star alone have indicated, but\nthis is still far short of what most SNIa models require. The absorption\nspectrum against a brighter z = 0.337 QSO seen at 57% of the shell radius shows\nbroad silicon absorption lines but no iron other than narrow, probably\ninterstellar lines. The cold iron expanding in this direction must be confined\nwithin v <~ 5200 km/s, also consistent with a high-velocity bulge on the far\nside only. The broad silicon lines indicate that the silicon layer has expanded\nbeyond this point, and that it has probably been heated by a reverse shock.\nFinally, the spectra of two ~ A0V stars near the southern shell rim show no\nbroad or unusually strong absorption lines, suggesting that the low-ionization\nejecta are confined within 83% of the shell radius, at least at the azimuths of\nthese background sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2006 02:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The magnetization dynamics is described by solving coupled\nsublattice Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations whose damping term is associated\nwith the scattering rate due to magnon-magnon interaction.

Over a little more than\nthe last decade loop quantum gravity has emerged as a widely studied candidate\nfor quantum gravity, where it is now possible to introduce black hole models\nwithin a quantum theory of gravity. This makes it possible to use only quantum\neffects which are known to arise also in the full theory, but still work in a\nrather simple and physically interesting context of black holes. Recent\ndevelopments have now led to the first physical results about non-rotating\nquantum black holes obtained in this way.

Namely, one can\nrelax the reconstruction problem, which is highly nonconvex, to a convex\nproblem -- and, moreover, to a linear program. However, when is exactly the\nreconstruction problem equivalent to its convex relaxation is an open question.\nRecent work of many authors shows that the number of measurements k(r,n) needed\nto exactly reconstruct any r-sparse signal f of length n (a vector in R^n of\nsupport r) from its linear measurements with the convex relaxation method is\nusually O(r polylog(n)).
