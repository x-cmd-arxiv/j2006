The similarities in the host\nproperties (color and concentration index) of Seyferts and LINERs suggest that\nthe difference in their r_0 is not driven by the morphology-density relation.\nWe find that the luminosity of [O I] emission shows the strongest influence on\nAGN clustering, with low L([O I]) sources having the highest r_0.

High-resolution N-body/SPH simulations in a\ncosmological context are presented including cold gas and dark matter. A halo\nwith quiet merging activity since z~3.8 and with a high spin parameter is\nanalysed that should be an ideal candidate for the formation of an extended\ngalactic disk. We show that the gas and the dark matter have similar specific\nangular momenta until a merger event occurs at z~2 with a mass ratio of 5:1.\nAll the gas involved in the merger loses a substantial fraction of its specific\nangular momentum due to tidal torques and falls quickly into the center.\nDynamical friction plays a minor role,in contrast to previous claims. In fact,\nafter this event a new extended disk begins to form from gas that was not\ninvolved in the 5:1 merger event and that falls in subsequently. We argue that\nthe angular momentum problem of disk galaxy formation is a merger problem: in\ncold dark matter cosmology substantial mergers with mass ratios of 1:1 to 6:1\nare expected to occur in almost all galaxies. We suggest that energetic\nfeedback processes could in principle solve this problem, however only if the\nheating occurs at the time or shortly before the last substantial merger event.\nGood candidates for such a coordinated feedback would be a merger-triggered\nstar burst or central black hole heating. If a large fraction of the low\nangular momentum gas would be ejected as a result of these processes, late-type\ngalaxies could form with a dominant extended disk component, resulting from\nlate infall, a small bulge-to-disk ratio and a low baryon fraction, in\nagreement with observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2006 21:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

From this investigation, we find that among the total\ndetectable Earth-mass planets from the survey, those located in the habitable\nzone would comprise less than 1% even under a less-conservative definition of\nthe habitable zone. We find the main reason for the low sensitivity is that the\nprojected star-planet separation at which the microlensing planet detection\nefficiency becomes maximum (lensing zone) is in most cases substantially larger\nthan the median value of the habitable zone. We find that the ratio of the\nmedian radius of the habitable zone to the mean radius of the lensing zone is\nroughly expressed as $d_{\\rm HZ}/r_{\\rm E}\\sim 0.2(m/0.5 M_\\odot)^{1/2}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Jan 2006 22:38:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The origin of life as a planetary phenomenon\nwill probably resist successful explanation as long as we lack an early record\nof its evolution and additional examples. It is widely thought that the\ngeologic record shows that life emerged quickly after the end of prolonged\nbombardment of the Earth. New data and simulations contradict that view and\nsuggest that more than half a billion years of unrecorded Earth history may\nhave elapsed between the origin of life and LUCA. The impact-driven exchange of\nmaterial between the inner planets may have allowed earliest life to be more\ncosmopolitan. Indeed, terrestrial life may not have originated on the Earth, or\neven on any planet. Smaller bodies, e.g. the parent bodies of primitive\nmeteorites, offer alternative environments for the origin of life in our Solar\nSystem. The search for past or present life on Mars is an obvious path to\ngreater enlightenment. The subsurface oceans of some icy satellites of the\nouter planets represent the best locales to search for an independent origin of\nlife in the Solar System because of the high dynamical barriers for transfer,\nintense radiation at their surfaces, and thick ice crusts.

To\nanalyze the RG theorems and other aspects of TDDFT, an utmost simplification of\nthe KS theory is introduced, in which the density is obtained from a single KS\nequation for one spatial (spin-less) particle. This radical KS formulation\nallows us to analyze also the concept of KS-type equations derived without a\nvariational principle.

We show that, in this scenario HVT leads to Bell type\ninequalities for the correlation between the outputs of successive\nmeasurements.
