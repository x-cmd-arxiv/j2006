This study presents new models of\nthese objects based on the hierarchical chemical evolution framework of\nTumlinson (2006). The model accurately reproduces the observed\nluminosity-metallicity relation of fossil dwarf galaxies with minimal free\nparameters. When calibrated to this relation, the models show that small dark\nmatter ``minihalos'' formed 2 - 8% of their baryonic mass into stars prior\nduring reionization. By tracking the chemical enrichment of these early halos\nthe models specify that metal-free first stars contributed approximately 5 - 10\n% of the ionizing photons generated by these small halos and so did not\ndominate reionization. Models that allow for larger relative contributions from\nmetal-free stars may not generate enough total ionizing photons for early\nreionization. As significant star formation in early minihalos is a requirement\nof many successful models for the IGM reionization, these models can be\nconsidered to pass a key test of their validity. It appears we have as much to\nlearn about reionization from the universe at z = 0 as at z = 6.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Feb 2006 20:34:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Previous observations with ROSAT and ASCA\nprovided evidence for an ongoing merger, but also suggested that there were two\nsurviving cooling cores, which were associated with the two cD galaxies in the\ncenter of the cluster. The Chandra observation reveals only one X-ray surface\nbrightness peak, which is associated with the more luminous, southern cD\ngalaxy. The gas related with that peak is cool and displaced slightly from the\nposition of the cD. The data suggest that this cool material has formed a cold\nfront. On the other hand, in the higher spatial resolution Chandra image, the\nsecond feature to the north is not associated with the northern cD; rather, it\nappears to be a trail of gas behind the main cD. We argue that only one of the\ntwo cooling cores has survived the merger, although it is possible that the\nnorthern cD may not have possessed a cool core prior to the merger. We use the\ncool core survival to constrain the kinematics of the merger and we find an\nupper limit of ~< 1900 km/s for the merger relative velocity.

A\ntight-binding representation shows that intraplanar second neighbor hopping\n$t_2 = 100$ meV dominates the first neighbor interaction ($t_1 = 64$ meV). The\nfirst and third neighbor couplings are strongly modified by oxygen\ndisplacements of the symmetric Raman-active vibrational mode, and\nelectron-phonon coupling to this motion may provide the coupling mechanism for\nsuperconductivity in Li-deficient samples (where $T_c = 5$ K). We calculate all\nzone-center phonon modes, identify infrared (IR) and Raman active modes, and\nreport LO-TO splitting of the IR modes. The Born effective charges for the\nmetal ions are found to have considerable anisotropy reflecting the degree to\nwhich the ions participate in interlayer coupling and covalent bonding. Insight\ninto the microscopic origin of the valence band density, composed of Nb\n$d_{z^2}$ states with some mixing of O $2p$ states, is obtained from examining\nWannier functions for these bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2006 03:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jun 2006 22:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The production of $\\phi$ and $\\Omega$ are shown to arise mainly from the\nrecombination of thermal partons, thus exhibiting exponential $p_T$ dependences\nin agreement with the data. Their ratio, $R_{\\Omega/\\phi}$, rises linearly to\n$p_T\\approx 4$ GeV/c and develops a maximum at $p_T\\approx 5.5$ GeV/c. It is\nargued that the $p_T$ spectra of $\\phi$ and $\\Omega$ reveal directly the\npartonic nature of the thermal source that characterizes quark-gluon plasma.\nComments are made on the $\\Omega$ puzzle due to the simultaneous observation of\nboth the exponential behavior of the $\\Omega$ spectrum in $p_T$ and the\nexistence of low-$p_T$ particles associated with $\\Omega$ as trigger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Feb 2006 00:16:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2006 18:40:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Feb 2007 22:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-05-29"}
