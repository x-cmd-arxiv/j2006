By design, the map also covers the\nregion mapped in the infrared with the Spitzer Space Telescope. We detect 44\ndefinite sources, and a few likely sources are also seen along a filament in\nthe eastern streamer. The map indicates that dense cores in Ophiuchus are very\nclustered and often found in filaments within the cloud. Most sources are\nround, as measured at the half power point, but elongated when measured at\nlower contour levels, suggesting spherical sources lying within filaments. The\nmasses, for an assumed dust temperature of 10 K, range from 0.24 to 3.9 solar\nmasses, with a mean value of 0.96 solar masses. The total mass in distinct\ncores is 42 solar masses, 0.5 to 2% of the total cloud mass, and the total mass\nabove 4 sigma is about 80 solar masses. The mean densities in the cores are\nquite high, with an average of 1.6 x 10^6 per cc, suggesting short free-fall\ntimes. The core mass distribution can be fitted with a power law with slope of\n2.1 plus or minus 0.3 for M>0.5 solar masses, similar to that found in other\nregions, but slightly shallower than that of some determinations of the local\nIMF. In agreement with previous studies, our survey shows that dense cores\naccount for a very small fraction of the cloud volume and total mass. They are\nnearly all confined to regions with visual extinction at least 9 mag, a lower\nthreshold than found previously.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Feb 2006 20:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

For instance, the chaotic Chua's circuit\ncoupled to a circuit with a non-invertible I-V characteristic can generate\nunpredictable dynamics. In general, a nonperiodic time-series with truncated\nexponential behavior can be converted into unpredictable dynamics using\nnon-invertible transformations. Using a new theoretical framework for chaos and\nrandomness, we investigate some classes of coupled map lattices. We show that,\nin some cases, these systems can produce completely unpredictable dynamics. In\na similar fashion, we explain why some wellknown spatiotemporal systems have\nbeen found to produce very complex dynamics in numerical simulations.
