Emergent non-commutivity due to\nthe fractal nature of sample trajectories is closely related to the fact that\nthe forward and backward time derivatives are different for these diffusions. A\nnew variational approach to stochastic mechanics based on trace dynamics is\nintroduced. It is shown that Yasue's method and Guerra and Morato's method can\nboth be generalized to allow for any diffusion constant in a stochastic model\nof Schrodinger's equation, and that they can all also describe dissipative\ndiffusion. Then it is shown that the trace dynamical theory seems to only\ndescribe dissipative diffusion unless an extra quantum mechanical potential\nterm is added to the Hamiltonian.\n  The differential space theory of Wiener and Siegel is reconsidered as a\nuseful tool in this framework, and is generalized to stochastic processes\ninstead of deterministic ones for the hidden trajectories of observables. It is\nproposed that the natural measure space for Wiener-Siegel theory is Haar\nmeasure for random unitary matrices. A new interpretation of the polychotomic\nalgorithm is given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2006 17:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Mar 2006 13:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We\nthen point out that {\\em all} those against the algorithm are either misleading\nor misunderstanding, and that the algorithm is self consistent. The only\ncentral argument against physical implementations of the algorithm, on the\nother hand, is based on an assumption that its Hamiltonians cannot be\neffectively constructed due to a lack of infinite precision. However, so far\nthere is no known physical principle dictating why that cannot be done. To show\nthat the criticism may not be a forgone conclusion, we point out the virtually\nunknown fact that, on the contrary, simple instances of Diophantine equations\nwith apparently {\\em infinitely precisely} integer coefficients have {\\em\nalready} been realised in experiments for certain quantum phase transitions. We\nalso speculate on how central limit theorem of statistics might be of some help\nin the effective implementation of the required Hamiltonians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Feb 2006 12:08:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2006 13:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
