It is argued that the two basic\ncharacteristics of a flow event (a jump between two energy minima in\nconfiguration space) are the local density change and the sum of all particle\ndisplacements. Based on this it is proposed that density fluctuations are\ndescribed by a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with rates in k-space of\nthe form $\\Gamma_0+Dk^2$ with $D\\gg\\Gamma_0a^2$ where $a$ is the average\nintermolecular distance. The inequality expresses a long-wavelength dominance\nof the dynamics which implies that the Hamiltonian (free energy) may be taken\nto be ultra local. As an illustration of the theory the case with the simplest\nnon-trivial Hamiltonian is solved to second order in the Gaussian\napproximation, where it predicts an asymmetric frequency dependence of the\nisothermal bulk modulus with Debye behavior at low frequencies and an\n$\\omega^{-1/2}$ decay of the loss at high frequencies. Finally, a general\nformalism for the description of viscous liquid dynamics, which supplements the\ndensity dynamics by including stress fields, a potential energy field, and\nmolecular orientational fields, is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Feb 2006 21:52:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Feb 2006 18:20:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Feb 2006 22:06:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 25 Feb 2006 21:50:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 12 Jun 2006 09:33:17 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 19 Jun 2006 08:06:02 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 20 Jun 2006 06:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Mon, 17 Jul 2006 23:24:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

To exploit the spatial diversity benefit we propose a\ncluster-based collaborating strategy for a quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel\nmodel and based on a network geometric distance profile. Our scheme enhances\nthe network performance by embedding an IR cooperative coding scheme into an\nexisting noncooperative route. More precisely, for each hop, we form a\ncollaborating cluster of M-1 nodes between the (hop) sender and the (hop)\ndestination. The transmitted message is encoded using a mother code and\npartitioned into M blocks corresponding to the each of M slots. In the first\nslot, the (hop) sender broadcasts its information by transmitting the first\nblock, and its helpers attempt to relay this message. In the remaining slots,\nthe each of left-over M-1 blocks is sent either through a helper which has\nsuccessfully decoded the message or directly by the (hop) sender where a\ndynamic schedule is based on the ACK-based feedback from the cluster.

Finally we suggest a way\nto manipulate the decay rate of the system and to observe a controlled\ncontinuous passage from decay suppression to decay acceleration using\nengineered reservoirs in the trapped ion context .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Feb 2006 12:06:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Oct 2006 09:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}
