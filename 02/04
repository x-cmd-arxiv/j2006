Plausible origins for this core emission include the outer\nregions of an accretion disk, a pc-scale molecular torus, and the optical\nbroad-line region (BLR). Using data from the literature it is shown that no\ncorrelation exists between the Fe K-alpha core width and the BLR (specifically\nH-beta) line width. This shows that in general the iron K-alpha core emission\ndoes not arise from the BLR. There is a similar lack of correlation between the\nwidth of the Fe K-alpha core and black hole mass. The average K-alpha width is\nabout a factor of two lower than the H-beta width. It therefore seems likely\nthat in many cases the narrow core arises in the torus. There is a very wide\nrange of observed Fe K-alpha core widths, however, and this argues for multiple\norigins. The simplest explanation for the observed line profiles in AGN is that\nthey are due to a mixing of very narrow emission from the inner edge of the\ntorus, and broadened emission from the accretion disk, in varying proportions\nfrom object-to-object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2006 17:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The triplet state measures exemplify that\nthe magnitude of the spatial correlations relative to the momentum\ncorrelations, depends on, and may be controlled by the strength of the\nelectronic correlation. Examination of one and two-electron Shannon entropies\nin the triplet state series yields a crossover point, which is characterized by\na localized momentum density. The mutual information density in momentum space\nillustrates that this localization is accompanied by strong correlation at\nsmall values of $p$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Feb 2006 16:55:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-13"}

For the example of an oscillator coupled to a bath described by the\nsingle relaxation time model, the mean oscillator energy and the minimum work\nrequired to couple the oscillator to the bath are both calculated explicitly\nand in closed form.
