Both of these bursts exhibit rapidly declining early X-ray\nafterglow lightcurves; this emission is from the same source that produced the\ngamma-ray burst.

An approximate theoretical approach, that\ndescribes the particle dynamics exactly in any vertical cluster of two parallel\nsites and neglects the correlations between the different vertical clusters, is\napplied to calculate stationary-state density profiles, currents and phase\ndiagrams. Surprisingly, it is found that asymmetry in the coupling between the\nchannels leads to a very complex phase behavior that is very different from\ntwo-channel simple exclusion processes with symmetric coupling. There are seven\nstationary-state phases in the simple exclusion processes with asymmetric\ntransition rates between the channels, in contrast to three phases found for\nthe systems with symmetric coupling. In addition, a new maximal-current phase\nwith a domain wall in the middle of the lattices, that has no analogs in other\nexclusion processes, is observed. Although the explicit calculations are\npresented only for the case of full asymmetry, when the particles can only jump\nbetween the channels in one direction, the properties of two-channel simple\nexclusion systems with general asymmetry are also discussed. Theoretical\npredictions are in excellent agreement with extensive computer Monte Carlo\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Feb 2006 21:04:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

The many\ntraversals through a thin foil enhance the nuclear reaction probability, in a\nsteady configuration in which ionisation losses are recovered at each turn by a\nRF-cavity. For a uniform target \"foil\" the longitudinal momentum spread\ndiverges exponentially since faster (slower) particles ionise less (more) than\nthe average. In order to \"cool\" also longitudinally, a chromaticity has to be\nintroduced with a wedge shaped \"foil\". Multiple scattering and straggling are\nthen \"cooled\" in all three dimensions, with a method similar to the one of\nsynchrotron cooling, but valid for low energy ions. Particles then stably\ncirculate in the beam indefinitely, until they undergo for instance nuclear\nprocesses in the thin target foil. This new method is under consideration for\nthe nuclear production of a few MeV/A ion beams. Simple reactions, for instance\nLi 7 + D Li 8 + p, are more favourably exploited with the heavier ion colliding\nagainst a gas-jet D2 target. Kinematics is generally very favourable, with\nemission angles in a narrow angular cone and a relatively concentrated outgoing\nenergy spectrum which allows an efficient collection as a neutral gas in a tiny\nvolume with a technology at high temperatures perfected at ISOLDE.
