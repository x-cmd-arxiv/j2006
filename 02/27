Such models require fine-tuning of highly uncertain microscopic\ntransport properties to distribute the thermal thermal over the entire cluster\ncooling core. We propose that the ICM is instead heated by multiple, spatially\ndistributed AGNs. There is mounting observational evidence for multiple AGNs in\ncluster environments. Active AGNs drive bubbles into the ICM. We identify three\ndistinct interactions between the bubble and the ICM: (1) Upon injection, the\nbubbles expand rapidly in situ to reach pressure equilibrium with their\nsurroundings, generating shocks and waves whose dissipation is the principal\nsource of ICM heating. (2) Once inflated, the bubbles rise buoyantly at rate\ndetermined by a balance with the viscous drag force, which itself results in\nsome additional heating. (3) Rising bubbles expand and compress their\nsurroundings. This process is adiabatic and does not contribute to any\nadditional heating; rather, the increased ICM density due to compression\nenhances cooling. Our model sidesteps the ``transport'' issue by relying on the\nspatially distributed galaxies to heat the cluster core. We include self\nregulation in our model by linking AGN activity in a galaxy to cooling\ncharacteristics of the surrounding ICM. We use a spherically symmetric\none-dimensional hydrodynamical code to carry out a preliminary study\nillustrating the efficacy of the model. Our self-regulating scenario predicts\nthat there should be enhanced AGN activity of galaxies inside the cooling\nregions compared to galaxies in the outer parts of the cluster.

The fits to the EPIC and RGS spectra\nprefer multi-temperature models especially in the core. The radial profiles of\noxygen and iron measured with EPIC/RGS and the line profiles in RGS suggest\nthat there is a dip in the O/Fe ratio in the centre of the cluster compared to\nits immediate surroundings. A possible explanation for the large scale\nmetallicity distribution is that SNIa and SNII products are released in the ICM\nthrough ram-pressure stripping of in-falling galaxies. This causes a peaked\nmetallicity distribution. In addition, SNIa in the central cD galaxy enrich\nmainly the centre of the cluster with iron. This excess of SNIa products is\nconsistent with the low O/Fe ratio we detect in the centre of the cluster. We\nfit the abundances we obtain with yields from SNIa, SNII and Population-III\nstars to derive the clusters chemical evolution. We find that the measured\nabundance pattern does not require a Population-III star contribution. The\nrelative contribution of the number of SNIa with respect to the total number of\nSNe which enrich the ICM is about 25-50%. Furthermore, we discuss the possible\npresence of a non-thermal component in the EPIC spectra. A potential source of\nthis non-thermal emission can be inverse-Compton scattering between Cosmic\nMicrowave Background (CMB) photons and relativistic electrons, which are\naccelerated in bow shocks associated with ram-pressure stripping of in-falling\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 13:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the absence of\nexternal electric field, this charge separation comes from different\n''spreading-out'' of the electron and hole wavefunctions linked to the finite\nheight of the barriers. When the dot size shrinks, the two-pair energy always\nstays below when the barriers are infinite. On the opposite, because barriers\nare less efficient for small dots, the energy of two-pairs in a dot with finite\nbarriers, ends by behaving like the one in bulk, i.e., by going above twice the\none-pair energy when the pairs get too close. For a full understanding of this\n''antibinding'' effect, we have also reconsidered the case of one pair plus one\ncarrier. We find that, while the carriers just have to spread out of the dot\ndifferently for the ''antibinding'' of two-pairs to appear, this\n''antibinding'' for one pair plus one carrier only appears if this carrier is\nthe one which spreads out the less. In addition a remarkable sum rule exists\nbetween the \"binding energies\" of two pairs and of one pair plus one carrier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 09:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

A simple formulation\nof the basic equations is given for the spacetime $M \\approx M^2 \\times\nK^{n-2}$ with a perfect fluid and a cosmological constant. This is a\ngeneralization of the Misner-Sharp formalism of the four-dimensional\nspherically symmetric spacetime with a perfect fluid in general relativity. The\nwhole picture and the final fate of the gravitational collapse of a dust cloud\ndiffer greatly between the cases with $n=5$ and $n \\ge 6$. There are two\nfamilies of solutions, which we call plus-branch and the minus-branch\nsolutions. Bounce inevitably occurs in the plus-branch solution for $n \\ge 6$,\nand consequently singularities cannot be formed. Since there is no trapped\nsurface in the plus-branch solution, the singularity formed in the case of\n$n=5$ must be naked. In the minus-branch solution, naked singularities are\nmassless for $n \\ge 6$, while massive naked singularities are possible for\n$n=5$. In the homogeneous collapse represented by the flat\nFriedmann-Robertson-Walker solution, the singularity formed is spacelike for $n\n\\ge 6$, while it is ingoing-null for $n=5$. In the inhomogeneous collapse with\nsmooth initial data, the strong cosmic censorship hypothesis holds for $n \\ge\n10$ and for $n=9$ depending on the parameters in the initial data, while a\nnaked singularity is always formed for $5 \\le n \\le 8$. These naked\nsingularities can be globally naked when the initial surface radius of the dust\ncloud is fine-tuned, and then the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis is\nviolated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 08:11:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 May 2006 06:26:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-11-11"}

After a brief\nhistorical background, this paper presents and analyses the projective Cartan\nand Tractor connections, the various structures they can preserve, and their\ngeometric interpretations. Preserved subbundles of the Tractor bundle generate\nfoliations with Ricci-flat leaves. Contact- and Einstein-structures arise from\nother reductions of the Tractor holonomy, as do U(1) and $Sp(1, \\mathbb{H})$\nbundles over a manifold of smaller dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Feb 2006 14:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Aug 2006 13:50:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Sep 2006 15:09:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 13 Mar 2007 17:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

When coupled with a diffuse beam edge and/or perturbations\ninternal to the beam core that can drive particles outside the edge, this\nmechanism can result in large and rapid halo-driven increases in the\nstatistical phase-space area of the beam, lost particles, and degraded\ntransport.
